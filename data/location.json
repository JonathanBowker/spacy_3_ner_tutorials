The term typically refers only to the areas that were part of Germany prior to the Nazi regime coming to power and excludes some or all of the territories annexed by Nazi Germany, such as Austria or the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Overall, of the 522,000 Jews living in Germany in January 1933, approximately 304,000 emigrated during the first six years of Nazi rule and about 214,000 were left on the eve of World War II. Of these, 160,000-180,000 were killed as a part of the Holocaust. On May 19, 1943, only about 20,000 Jews remained and Germany was declared judenrein.[1]",

Initially, they were to be expelled to the Generalgouvernement.[33][34] However, the ultimate destination for the massive removal of Jews was left open until the Final Solution was set in motion two years later.[35]",

They had transferable SS staff.[127] There was a railway platform constructed alongside the tracks, surrounded by 2.5\u00a0m (8\u00a0ft) high barbed-wire fencing. Large barracks were built for storing belongings of disembarking victims. One was disguised as a railway station complete with a fake wooden clock and signage to prevent new arrivals from realizing their fate.[128] Passports and money were collected for \"safekeeping\" at a cashier's booth set up by the \"Road to Heaven\", a fenced-off path leading into the gas chambers disguised as communal showers. Directly behind were the burial pits, dug with a crawler excavator.[129][130]",

By the end of that summer, the number had risen to about 205,000\u2013210,000 (with 240,000 registrations and over 30,000 duplicates).[278] The survivors included 180,000 Jews who arrived from the Soviet-controlled territories as a result repatriation agreements.

Five transports with five thousand Jews departed from Prague on 16, 21, 26 and 30 October and 3 November, arriving in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a the next day.[75][76] One transport, on 16 November, took Jews from Brno to Minsk.[77] Unlike later transports, the passenger list had been drawn up by the Gestapo.[75] Most of the deportees to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a were elderly, and by April 1942 sixteen percent had already died.[78] That month, Heinrich Himmler ordered the murder of 10,000 of the remaining Austrian, German, and Czech deportees: between 4 and 15 May, 10,993 Jews were deported in Kulmhof.[79] Only 277 of the Czech deportees survived the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto and subsequent deportations to extermination camps.[80]",

(An amalgamation of 100,000 to 150,000 Ukrainian and other Soviet citizens were also killed in the following weeks). The mass killing of Jews in Kiev was decided on by the military governor Major-General Friedrich Eberhardt, the Police Commander for Army Group South (SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Friedrich Jeckeln) and the Einsatzgruppe C Commander Otto Rasch. It was carried out by a mixture of SS, SD and Security Police. On the Monday, the Jews of Kiev gathered by the cemetery, expecting to be loaded onto trains. The crowd was large enough that most of the men, women, and children could not have known what was happening until it was too late: by the time they heard the machine-gun fire, there was no chance to escape. All were driven down a corridor of soldiers, in groups of ten, and then shot. A truck driver described the scene:",

In smaller towns, ghettos often served as staging points for Jewish slave-labor and mass deportation actions, while in the urban centers they resembled walled-off prison-islands described by some historians as little more than instruments of \"slow, passive murder\", with dead bodies littering the streets.[4] In most cases, the larger ghettos did not correspond to traditional Jewish neighborhoods, and non-Jewish Poles and members of other ethnic groups were ordered to take up residence elsewhere. Smaller Jewish communities with populations under 500 were terminated through expulsion soon after the invasion.[5][6]",

Renaming everything in their own image had been one way in which the invaders sought to redraw Europe's political map. All Polish territories were assigned as either Nazi zones of occupation (i.e. Bezirk Bialystok, Provinz Ostpreu\u00dfen, etc.), or annexed by the Soviet Union, soon to be overrun again in Operation Barbarossa.[3] The Soviet Ukraine and Byelorussia witnessed the \"Polish Operation\" of the NKVD, resulting in the virtual absence of ethnic Poles in the USSR along the pre-war border with Poland since the Great Purge.[18][19]",

Between October 1940 and May 1942, the first 4,000 Jews were deported. In May 1942 additional 2,000 and in August, 5,000 more. Deportations between August 1942 and mid June 1943 amounted to additional 5,000. On 22 June 1943 the next transport of 5,000 Jews departed to Auschwitz, and finally, between 1\u20133 August 1943, the remaining 8,000 were sent away. The dispersed Jews who stayed, amounting to 1,000 persons, were deported between early October 1943 and July 1944. In total, about 28,000 Jews are believed to have been deported from the B\u0119dzin Ghetto. This information however, is not confirmed by the two main sources of the remaining data nor the Jewish Historical Institute, listing only 7,000 victims.",

These were also the areas where Germans wounded from the Polish campaign were expected to be accommodated, which created a demand for hospital space. The Gauleiter of Pomerania, Franz Schwede-Coburg, sent 1,400 patients from five Pomeranian hospitals to undisclosed locations in occupied Poland, where they were shot. The Gauleiter of East Prussia, Erich Koch, had 1,600 patients killed out of sight. More than 8,000 Germans were killed in this initial wave of killings carried out on the orders of local officials, although Himmler certainly knew and approved of them.[40][69] The legal basis for the programme was a 1939 letter from Hitler, not a formal \"F\u00fchrer's decree\" with the force of law. Hitler bypassed Conti, the Health Minister and his department, who might have raised questions about the legality of the programme and entrusted it to Bouhler and Brandt.[70][k]",

Founded in 1886, it was located about 2\u00a0km south of the town center of Allenstein (Olsztyn), at the Kortsee (Lake Kortowskie). The hospital housed up to 1,400 patients from all over East Prussia. During World War II, many of Kortau's patients were sent to Germany and executed as part of Nazi Germany's euthanasia programme. Most of the remaining patients and staff were killed by the Red Army in January 1945.",

Among such factories were the modern Hannover plant (built in 1938), M\u00fclhausen, Vienna and the factory in Pozna\u0144 (1943) and Herbst (1944). AFA's factory in Viennese borough of Schwechat was one of the sub-camps of the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. The factory was destroyed by an RAF Bomber Command air raid on 2 December 1944 [1]. It provided batteries for, among others, the German U-Boats and Panzer tanks.",

Edwin Black asserts that IBM did so after the Sept 1, 1939 Nazi Invasion of Poland, and continued this business relationship during the Holocaust in Poland. Watson Business Machines operated a punch card printing shop near the Warsaw Ghetto.[5] In a 2002 editorial in the SFGate, Black maintains that this Polish subsidiary reported to IBM Geneva which in turn reported to IBM New York.  Black further states that IBM's European general manager reported directly to Thomas Watson, Sr., that some machines in Poland were sent to Romania to assist in the Jewish census there, and that these Polish machines were later replaced.[6] In his book, Black quotes Leon Krzemieniecki, the last surviving person involved in the Polish administration of the rail transportation to Auschwitz and Treblinka, as stating he knew the punched card machines were not German machines, because the labels were in English. Black claims that income from the machines leased in Poland was sent through Geneva to IBM in New York.[5][6]",

In 1879 there were 221 workers employed in Rudzki's Warsaw works, by the end of the 19th century the number rose to 890, while value of production rose from 180,000 roubles to 2,132,000 roubles.[4] In 1892 the company was also formally transformed into a joint stock company.[4][13]",

Heinrich Himmler instructed his camp commandants to destroy records, crematoria, and other signs of mass extermination.[21] As one of many examples, the bodies of the 25,000 mostly Latvian Jews whom Friedrich Jeckeln and the soldiers under his command had shot at Rumbula (near Riga) in late 1941 were dug up and burned in 1943.[22] Similar operations were undertaken at Belzec, Treblinka and other death camps.[21]",

During World War II and The Holocaust, Nazi Germany developed and used gas vans on a large scale as an extermination method to murder inmates of asylums, Poles, Romani people, Jews, and prisoners in occupied Poland, Belarus, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and other regions of German-occupied Europe.[2][3]",

With this appointment by Hitler, Himmler and his deputy, Heydrich, became two of the most powerful men in the internal administration of Germany.[57] Himmler immediately reorganised the police into two groups: the Ordnungspolizei (Order Police; Orpo), consisting of both the national uniformed police and the municipal police, and the Sicherheitspolizei (Security Police; SiPo), consisting of the Geheime Staatspolizei (Secret State Police; Gestapo) and Kriminalpolizei (Criminal Police; Kripo).[58] At that point, Heydrich was head of the SiPo and SD. Heinrich M\u00fcller was the Gestapo's operations chief.[59] Heydrich was assigned to help organise the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. The games were used to promote the propaganda aims of the Nazi regime. Goodwill ambassadors were sent to countries that were considering a boycott. Anti-Jewish violence was forbidden for the duration, and news stands were required to stop displaying copies of Der St\u00fcrmer.[60][61] For his part in the games' success, Heydrich was awarded the Deutsches Olympiaehrenzeichen or German Olympic Games Decoration (First Class).[37]",

A Jewish Ghetto Police force was also established.  In general the Latvian and the German ghettos were subject to separate administration, although the occupation Labor Authority drew personnel from both ghettos.",

The Nazi bureaucracy drew distinctions between different types of camps.  Officially, it was the Salaspils Police Prison and Re-Education Through Labor Camp (Polizeigef\u00e4ngnis und Arbeitserziehungslager).[1]  It was also known as camp Kurtenhof after the German name for the city of Salaspils. Planning for the development of the camp and its prisoner structure changed several times. In 1943, Heinrich Himmler briefly considered converting the camp into an official concentration camp (Konzentrationslager), which would have formally subordinated the camp to the National Security Main Office (Reichssicherheitshauptamt or RSHA), but nothing came of this.[2] The camp has had a lasting legacy in Latvian and Russian culture due to the severity of the treatment at the camp, especially with regard to children.",

There is a possibility that some 300 auxiliary policemen from Kiev helped organize the massacre in Babi Yar.[22] They also took part in the massacre in Dnipropetrovsk, where the field command noted that the cooperation ran \"smoothly in every way\". Cases where local commandants ordered murder of Jews using police force are known.[22] In killings of Jews in Kryvy Rih the \"entire Ukrainian auxiliary police\" was put to use.[22]",

The perpetrators were mainly from the new Selbstschutz battalions called the Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz, a paramilitary formation of civilian shooters composed of men from the German minority of pre-war Poland, as well as the Einsatzkommando 16 of SS Einsatzgruppen under command of SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer dr Rudolf Tr\u00f6ger.[4] Between September 1939 and April 1940 Selbstschutz - together with other Nazi-German formations - murdered tens of thousands of Poles in Pomerania.[citation needed] Established investigations point to Ludolf von Alvensleben and Jakub L\u00f6llgen, as the main organizers of the mass murder. Other Germans involved in the crime were: Sturmbannf\u00fchrers Erich Spaarmann, Meier, Schnugg, SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer dr Rudolf Tr\u00f6ger, SS man Baks, and a number of Volksdeutsche including Wilhelm Neumann, Herbert Beitsch, Otto Erlichmann (Nazi mayor of Fordon), and Walter Gassmann.

The unit, primarily composed of Lithuanian volunteers,[4] was formed by the German occupational government[5] and was subordinate to Einsatzkommando 9 and later to Sicherheitsdienst (SD) and Sicherheitspolizei (Sipo).[6] There are different estimates regarding the size of the unit. Polish historian Czes\u0142aw Michalski estimates that it grew from base of 50[7] while Tadeusz Piotrowski asserts about that there were 100 volunteers at its onset.[8] According to Michalski, after its initial creation, at various times hundreds of people were members.[7] Ar\u016bnas Bubnys states that it never exceeded a core of forty or fifty men.[9] 118 names are known; 20 of the members have been prosecuted and punished.[10] Together with German police, the squad participated in the Ponary massacre, where some 70,000 Jews were murdered,[11] along with estimated 20,000 Poles and 8,000 Russian POWs, many from nearby Vilnius.",

Soon afterward, G\u00f6ring detached the political and intelligence sections from the police and filled their ranks with Nazis. On 26 April 1933, G\u00f6ring merged the two units as the Geheime Staatspolizei, which was abbreviated by a post office clerk for a franking stamp and became known as the \"Gestapo\".[4][5] He originally wanted to name it the Secret Police Office (Geheimes Polizeiamt), but the German initials, \"GPA\", were too similar to those of the Soviet State Political Directorate (Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie, or GPU).[6]",

It served as a forerunner of the Gestapo in Bavaria, the secret police during the Nazi era, and was predominantly engaged in the persecution of political opponents of the Nazis.[1] The combination of political police and concentration camps under the control of the SS in Bavaria became the model for all of Nazi Germany, with Heinrich Himmler, within a short time, controlling all police forces in the country.[2] Munich, Bavaria's capital, became the testing ground for the Nazi terror of the following twelve years.[3]",

The difficult decision had to be made to have this people disappear from the earth.\u2014\u2009Heinrich Himmler, 6 October 1943[96] On 19 October 1943, five days after the prisoner revolt in Sobib\u00f3r, Operation Reinhard was terminated by Odilo Globocnik on behalf of Himmler. The camps responsible for the killing of nearly 2,700,000 Jews were soon closed. Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka were dismantled and ploughed over before spring.[97] The operation was followed by the single largest German massacre of Jews in the entire war carried out on 3 November 1943; with approximately 43,000 prisoners shot one-by-one simultaneously in three nearby locations by the Reserve Police Battalion 101 hand-in-hand with the Trawniki men from Ukraine.[98] Auschwitz alone had enough capacity to fulfill the Nazis' remaining extermination needs.[82]",

In addition, the Red Cross claimed that if it would take a major stance to improve the situation of those European Jews, the neutrality of Switzerland, where the International Red Cross was based, would be jeopardized. Today, the Red Cross acknowledges its passivity during the Holocaust and has apologized for this.[70]",

After laying a wreath, Brandt unexpectedly, and apparently spontaneously, knelt. He remained silently in that position for a short time (half a minute), surrounded by a large group of dignitaries and press photographers.[2] l Brandt had actively resisted the early Nazi regime, and had spent most of the time of Hitler's reign in exile. The occasion of Brandt's visit to Poland at the time was the signing of the Treaty of Warsaw between West Germany and Poland, guaranteeing German acceptance of the new borders of Poland. The treaty was one of the Brandt-initiated policy steps (the 'Ostpolitik') to ease tensions between West and East during the Cold War.",

Czarnieckiego) at number 14/16 (street renamed Schneidergasse by the Nazis, and the building indicated at number 12).[38] Like the prison discussed in the present article, the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a jail is frequently mentioned in the memoirs of Holocaust survivors (for example, by Holocaust witness Sara Zyskind (1927\u20131994), who speaks about \"the prison on Czarniecki Street\").[39] That facility is now defunct, and the building that housed it no longer extant.",

They ran social and cultural projects, and organised events and guided tours which drew attention to the history of Topf & S\u00f6hne during the Nazi period, which had been largely forgotten. The occupation was one of the most well known actions of left-radicals of that period in Germany. A book about the occupation was published in 2012, titled Topf & S\u00f6hne \u2013 Besetzung auf einem T\u00e4terort (Topf & S\u00f6hne \u2013 Occupation of a crime scene).[28] About 30 remaining squatters were evicted by the police on 16 April 2009.[5]",

At the time, the Red Cross justified its inaction by suggesting that aiding Jewish prisoners would harm its ability to help other Allied POWs. In addition, the Red Cross claimed that if it would take a major stance to improve the situation of those European Jews, the neutrality of Switzerland, where the International Red Cross was based, would be jeopardized. Today, the Red Cross acknowledges its passivity during the Holocaust and has apologized for this.[70]",

In 1924 he was elected to the Bund's Central Committee, a position he held until his death.[3] By 1930, Zygielbojm was editing the Jewish labor unions' journal, Arbeiter Fragen (\"Worker\u2019s Issues\").

When the Nazis occupied Warsaw, they demanded 12 hostages from the population to prevent further resistance. Stefan Starzy\u0144ski, the city's president, proposed that the Jewish labor movement provide a hostage, Ester Iwi\u0144ska. Zygielbojm volunteered in her place.[3] On his release, Zygielbojm was made a member of the Jewish Council, or Judenrat, which the Nazis had appointed. The Nazis ordered the Judenrat to begin the creation of a ghetto within Warsaw. Because of Zygielbojm's public opposition to the order, his fellow Bundists feared for his safety and arranged for him to leave. In December 1939, Zygielbojm reached Belgium. Early in 1940, he spoke before a meeting of the Labour and Socialist International in Brussels and described the early stages of the Nazi persecution of Polish Jewry.[2] When the Nazis invaded Belgium in May 1940, Zygielbojm went to France and then the US, where he spent a year and a half trying to convince Americans of the dire situation facing Jews in Nazi-occupied Poland.[2]",

The children and the elderly as well as anyone deemed \"unfit for work\" in the eyes of the Judenrat would follow them.[24] Rumkowski actively cooperated with the German demands hoping to save the majority of the ghetto inmates. Such behaviour set him at odds with the Orthodox observant Jews, because there could be no justification for delivering anyone to certain death. Following the creation of the extermination camp at Che\u0142mno in 1941, the Nazis ordered Rumkowski to organize several waves of deportations. Rumkowski claimed that he tried to convince the Germans to reduce the number of Jews required for deportation and failed.[25]",

Staffed by local inhabitants from German-occupied Byelorussia, it had similar functions to those of the German Ordnungspolizei in other occupied territories. The activities of the formation were supervised by defense police departments, local commandants' offices, and garrison commandants. The units consisted of one police officer for every 100 rural inhabitants and one police officer for every 300 urban inhabitants. The OD[clarification needed] was in charge of guard duty, and included both stationary and mobile posts plus groups of orderlies. It was subordinate to the defense police leadership.[1]",

There is a possibility that some 300 auxiliary policemen from Kiev helped organize the massacre in Babi Yar.[22] They also took part in the massacre in Dnipropetrovsk, where the field command noted that the cooperation ran \"smoothly in every way\". Cases where local commandants ordered murder of Jews using police force are known.[22] In killings of Jews in Kryvy Rih the \"entire Ukrainian auxiliary police\" was put to use.[22]",

The unit, primarily composed of Lithuanian volunteers,[4] was formed by the German occupational government[5] and was subordinate to Einsatzkommando 9 and later to Sicherheitsdienst (SD) and Sicherheitspolizei (Sipo).[6] There are different estimates regarding the size of the unit. Polish historian Czes\u0142aw Michalski estimates that it grew from base of 50[7] while Tadeusz Piotrowski asserts about that there were 100 volunteers at its onset.[8] According to Michalski, after its initial creation, at various times hundreds of people were members.[7] Ar\u016bnas Bubnys states that it never exceeded a core of forty or fifty men.[9] 118 names are known; 20 of the members have been prosecuted and punished.[10] Together with German police, the squad participated in the Ponary massacre, where some 70,000 Jews were murdered,[11] along with estimated 20,000 Poles and 8,000 Russian POWs, many from nearby Vilnius.",

Weigl also tried to protect the bacteriologist Filip Eisenberg, from Jagiellonian University, by offering him a position. Unfortunately, Eisenberg believed that he could survive the war by hiding in Krak\u00f3w, turned down Weigl's offer, and in 1943 was caught by the Nazis and sent to the Belzec extermination camp where he was murdered. In the end, about 4000 people (feeders, technicians and nurses) passed through Weigl's institute, of whom about 500 are known by name.[9]",

He served in the Reichswehr as a Zeitfreiwilliger (temporary volunteer) in the 19th Infantry Regiment (von Courbiere) at Frankfurt/Oder from 1920 to 1921.[2][3] Hanke obtained an education as a milling engineer by attending the German Millers' School at Dippoldiswalde. He then decided to obtain a year's practical experience as a railway workshop apprentice before returning to milling.[3] From 1921 to around 1926, Hanke mainly worked in the milling industry, serving as a business manager for mills in the vicinity of Silesia, Bavaria, and Tyrol.[3] He later attended the Berufsp\u00e4dagogische Institut in Berlin, receiving a degree that qualified him to teach milling at vocational schools.[3] Later in 1928, he worked in Berlin-Steglitz as a master miller.

They were given permission to work in plainclothes, when necessary. Their number increased in the following years. In 1811, their rules of service were written into the Berliner Polizeireglement (Berlin Police Regulations) and in 1820 the rank of Kriminalkommissar was introduced for criminal investigators. In 1872 the new Kriminalpolizei was made a separate branch of police service distinguishing it from the uniformed police called Schutzpolizei. Based on the experience with this new kind of police force, other German states\u2014such as Bremen in 1852\u2014reformed their police forces and by the end of the nineteenth century the Kriminalpolizei had been established nationwide. During the early part of the 20th century and post-World War I, the Kripo continued to serve as the German state's investigative agency for all criminal activity.",

There is a possibility that some 300 auxiliary policemen from Kiev helped organize the massacre in Babi Yar.[22] They also took part in the massacre in Dnipropetrovsk, where the field command noted that the cooperation ran \"smoothly in every way\". Cases where local commandants ordered murder of Jews using police force are known.[22] In killings of Jews in Kryvy Rih the \"entire Ukrainian auxiliary police\" was put to use.[22]",

The victims were deportees from Rumanian-controlled territory, it being Marshal Ion Antonescu's policy to racially \"cleanse\" the Rumanian nation. His preferred technique was to expel them to German-controlled territory and have the responsible SS/ Police units exterminate them. Many of these Jews were passed back and forth for weeks before a mix of Sk-R units and ethnic German Selbstschutz militia killed them. Most of these murders occurred in the County (Judetul) of Berezovca, where ethnic Germans, distributed among 40 or so villages, made up 40% of the population. Sk-R was commanded by SS-Standartenfuher Horst Hoffmeyer, a senior VoMi officer. His HQ was in Landau, located west of the River Bug.

Polish historian Czes\u0142aw Michalski estimates that it grew from base of 50[7] while Tadeusz Piotrowski asserts about that there were 100 volunteers at its onset.[8] According to Michalski, after its initial creation, at various times hundreds of people were members.[7] Ar\u016bnas Bubnys states that it never exceeded a core of forty or fifty men.[9] 118 names are known; 20 of the members have been prosecuted and punished.[10] Together with German police, the squad participated in the Ponary massacre, where some 70,000 Jews were murdered,[11] along with estimated 20,000 Poles and 8,000 Russian POWs, many from nearby Vilnius.",

Reorganized in 1919 under the Weimar Republic following World War I, it gradually became more militarized and transformed into a paramilitary force, also due to the economic woes of blockade, inflation and Great Depression. In Nazi Germany it was reformed again in 1937 by Fritz Reinhardt, a State Secretary of the Finance Ministry. It came to comprise about 50,000 officials. The Border Police (Grenzpolizei), which had the tasks of passport and border control,   was different from the Customs Border Guards. (Zollgrenzschutz).[1] Heinrich Himmler tried to bring the Zollgrenzschutz under the control of the Schultzstaffel (SS), which was unsuccessful at first. During the war, the units were used in occupied territories outside of Germany. A significant portion of younger officials were recruited to the Wehrmacht, leaving the Zollgrenzschutz with older men. After the 20 July 1944 assassination attempt on Hitler, the units were taken out of the control of the Finance Ministry and placed under Amt IV (Gestapo) of the Reich Security Main Office RSHA.[1] It was deactivated at the end of World War II in Europe when Germany was partitioned.",

With this appointment by Hitler, Himmler and his deputy, Heydrich, became two of the most powerful men in the internal administration of Germany.[57] Himmler immediately reorganised the police into two groups: the Ordnungspolizei (Order Police; Orpo), consisting of both the national uniformed police and the municipal police, and the Sicherheitspolizei (Security Police; SiPo), consisting of the Geheime Staatspolizei (Secret State Police; Gestapo) and Kriminalpolizei (Criminal Police; Kripo).[58] At that point, Heydrich was head of the SiPo and SD. Heinrich M\u00fcller was the Gestapo's operations chief.[59] Heydrich was assigned to help organise the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. The games were used to promote the propaganda aims of the Nazi regime. Goodwill ambassadors were sent to countries that were considering a boycott. Anti-Jewish violence was forbidden for the duration, and news stands were required to stop displaying copies of Der St\u00fcrmer.[60][61] For his part in the games' success, Heydrich was awarded the Deutsches Olympiaehrenzeichen or German Olympic Games Decoration (First Class).[37]",

However, except for the Nisko Plan, none of the territorial solutions progressed beyond the planning stage. Instead, the Nazi Germans implemented the near-complete extermination of the European Jews through the Holocaust.",

Effectively it remained outside DAW control by staying under the direct aegis of Globo\u010dnik.[22] This changed only in 1943, after Globo\u010dnik resigned as the Lublin district SS-and-Police Leader and the camp became the sub-camp of Majdanek concentration camp complex.[22]",

The Posen speeches were two speeches made by Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS of Nazi Germany, on 4 and 6 October 1943 in the town hall of Posen (Pozna\u0144), in German-occupied Poland. The recordings are the first known documents in which a member of the Hitler Cabinet spoke of the ongoing extermination of the Jews in extermination camps.

Cultural life was booming.[4] Bia\u0142ystok was overrun by the Wehrmacht on September 15, 1939, during the German invasion of Poland, and one week later handed over to the Red Army attacking from the East, in accordance with the German\u2013Soviet Frontier Treaty.[5] On November 1\u20132, 1939, the prewar Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship along with over half of the Second Polish Republic were annexed by the Soviet Union, becoming part of the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic.[6][7] During the Soviet occupation, Jewish companies and shops were closed, and Jewish social, educational, and political institutions were considered illegal. In addition many Jewish and Polish \"capitalists\" were deported by Soviet authorities to Siberia.[4] Thousands of Jewish refugees flocked in from the German zone of occupied Poland. The city remained in Soviet hands until June 1941.[4]",

While Jewish families hid in their so-called \"bunkers\", fighters of the \u017bZW, joined by elements of the \u017bOB, resisted, engaging the Germans in direct clashes.[19] Though the \u017bZW and \u017bOB suffered heavy losses (including some of their leaders), the Germans also took casualties, and the deportation was halted within a few days. Only 5,000 Jews were removed, instead of the 8,000 planned by Globocnik.  Hundreds of people in the Warsaw Ghetto were ready to fight, adults and children, sparsely armed with handguns, gasoline bottles, and a few other weapons that had been smuggled into the ghetto by resistance fighters.[3] Most of the Jewish fighters did not view their actions as an effective measure by which to save themselves, but rather as a battle for the honour of the Jewish people, and a protest against the world's silence.[16]",

By my death, I wish to give expression to my most profound protest against the inaction in which the world watches and permits the destruction of the Jewish people.[29] The suppression of the uprising officially ended on 16 May 1943, when Stroop personally pushed a detonator button to demolish the Great Synagogue of Warsaw.[citation needed] Besides claiming an estimated 56,065 Jews accounted for (although his own figures showed the number to be 57,065) and noting that \"The number of destroyed dug-outs amounts to 631,\" in his official report dated 24 May 1943, Stroop listed the following as captured booty:[30]",

All the same, the German casualty figures cited by the various Jewish sources are probably highly exaggerated.\"[33][34] Other historians such as the French L. MacLean[citation needed] endorse the accuracy of official German casualty figures. On the other hand, the Stroop report vastly exaggerated the actual losses (and strength) of the resistance.[clarification needed] The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising was the largest single revolt by Jews during World War II.[35]",

If there's a school to study the human spirit, there it should be a major subject. The important things were inherent in the force shown by Jewish youth after years of degradation, to rise up against their destroyers, and determine what death they would choose: Treblinka or Uprising.[44] On 7 December 1970, West German Chancellor Willy Brandt spontaneously knelt while visiting the Monument to the Ghetto Heroes memorial in the People's Republic of Poland. At the time, the action surprised many and was the focus of controversy, but it has since been credited with helping improve relations between the NATO and Warsaw Pact countries. Many people from the United States and Israel came for the 1983 commemoration.[45] The last surviving Jewish resistance fighter, Simcha Rotem, died in Jerusalem on 22 December 2018, at age 94.[46][47]",

On 23 July, about 120 of the most respected citizens and members of the Jewish intelligentsia were selected from among the Jews and assembled in the square. The selection was carried out according to a list compiled by the collaborationist Belarusian Auxiliary Police (established on 7 July 1941)[5] for the use by the SS Einsatzkommando killing squad arriving in Zdzi\u0119cio\u0142. Among those arrested were Alter Dvoretsky (an attorney active in the Communist Poale Zion), the rabbi, and Jankel Kaplan. The local Jews bribed the Germans to attain the release of Dvoretsky and the rabbi. All the others were allegedly taken away for forced labor, but two days later it was discovered that they had been transported to the forest near the military barracks in Nowogr\u00f3dek and murdered there.",

Romani prisoners in German concentration camps such as Auschwitz were forced to wear the brown inverted triangle on their prison uniforms so they could be distinguished from other inmates.[31] The Third Reich's government began persecuting the Romani as early as 1936 when they started to transfer the people to municipal internment camps on the outskirts of cities, a prelude to their deportation to concentration camps. A December 1937 decree on \"crime prevention\" provided the pretext for major roundups of Gypsies. Nine representatives of the Romani community in Germany were asked to compile lists of \"pure-blooded\" Romanis to be saved from deportation. However, the Germans often ignored these lists, and some individuals identified on them were still sent to concentration camps.[32] Notable internment and concentration camps include Dachau, Dieselstrasse, Marzahn (which evolved from a municipal internment camp) and Vennhausen.",

Ghetto diarist Emmanuel Ringelblum speculated that Romani were sent to the Warsaw Ghetto because the Germans wanted:...\u00a0to toss into the Ghetto everything that is characteristically dirty, shabby, bizarre, of which one ought to be frightened, and which anyway has to be destroyed.[33] Initially, there was disagreement within the Nazi circles about how to solve the \"Gypsy Question\".  In late 1939 and early 1940, Hans Frank, the General Governor of occupied Poland, refused to accept the 30,000 German and Austrian Roma which were to be deported to his territory.  Heinrich Himmler \"lobbied to save a handful of pure-blooded Roma\", whom he believed to be an ancient Aryan people for his \"ethnic reservation\", but was opposed by Martin Bormann, who favored deportation for all Roma.[18]  The debate ended in 1942 when Himmler signed the order to begin the mass deportations of Roma to Auschwitz concentration camp. During Operation Reinhard (1941\u201343), an undetermined number of Roma were killed in the extermination camps, such as Treblinka.[34]",

The polychromy was renewed in 1729 by Isaac ben Yehuda Leib Cohen of Jarycz\u00f3w and Mordechai Li\u015bnicki of Jarycz\u00f3w. Additions over time include a vestibule, women's sections, and a brick wing that served as a small synagogue, which could be heated in winter, and as a Cheder. The synagogue was destroyed by fire during World War I, when the Russian front moved through the town.

The difficult decision had to be made to have this people disappear from the earth.\u2014\u2009Heinrich Himmler, 6 October 1943[96] On 19 October 1943, five days after the prisoner revolt in Sobib\u00f3r, Operation Reinhard was terminated by Odilo Globocnik on behalf of Himmler. The camps responsible for the killing of nearly 2,700,000 Jews were soon closed. Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka were dismantled and ploughed over before spring.[97] The operation was followed by the single largest German massacre of Jews in the entire war carried out on 3 November 1943; with approximately 43,000 prisoners shot one-by-one simultaneously in three nearby locations by the Reserve Police Battalion 101 hand-in-hand with the Trawniki men from Ukraine.[98] Auschwitz alone had enough capacity to fulfill the Nazis' remaining extermination needs.[82]",

For example, it is found in the works of Martin Luther and contemporaries.[1] It appears in the title of a cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach, Nur jedem das Seine (BWV 163), first performed at Weimar in 1715.[2] Some nineteenth-century comedies bear the title Jedem das Seine, including works by Johann Friedrich Rochlitz[3] and Caroline Bernstein.[4] An ironic twist on the proverb, \"jedem das Seine, mir das Meiste\" (\"to each his own, to me the most\"), has been known in the reservoir of German idioms for a long time, including its inclusion in Carl Zuckmayer's 1931 play The Captain of K\u00f6penick. In 1937, the Nazis constructed the Buchenwald concentration camp, 7\u00a0km from Weimar, Germany. The motto Jedem das Seine was placed in the camp's main entrance gate. The gates were designed by Franz Ehrlich, a former student of the Bauhaus art school, who had been imprisoned in the camp because he was a communist.[5][6]",

It was initially commanded by SS-Oberstgruppenf\u00fchrer und Generaloberst der Polizei Kurt Daluege. In May 1943, Daluege had a massive heart attack and was removed from duty.[10] He was replaced by SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer und General der Waffen-SS und der Polizei Alfred W\u00fcnnenberg, who served until the end of the war. By 1941, the Orpo had been divided into the following offices covering every aspect of German law enforcement. The central command office known as the Ordnungspolizei Hauptamt was located in Berlin. From 1943 it was considered a full SS-Headquarters command.[11] The Orpo main office consisted of Command Department (Kommandoamt), responsible for finance, personnel and medical; Administrative (Verwaltung) charged with pay, pensions and permits; Economic (Wirtschaftsverwaltungsamt);  Technical Emergency Service (Technische Nothilfe); Fire Brigades Bureau (Feuerwehren); Colonial Police (Kolonialpolizei); and SS and Police Technical Training Academy (Technische SS-und Polizeiakademie).[12]",

The division was formed in October 1939, when thousands of members of the Orpo were drafted and placed together with artillery and signals units transferred from the army.[34] The division consisted of four police regiments composed of Orpo personnel and was typically used to rotate police members into a military situation, so as not to lose police personnel to the general draft of the Wehrmacht or to the full SS divisions of the regular Waffen-SS. Very late in the war several Orpo SS-Police regiments were transferred to the Waffen-SS to form the 35th SS Division.[citation needed]",

The largest collection point was in Warsaw next to the Warsaw Ghetto. In 1942 between 254,000 \u2013 265,000 Jews passed through the Warsaw Umschlagplatz on their way to the Treblinka extermination camp during Operation Reinhard,[1] the deadliest phase of the Holocaust in Poland.[2][3] Often those awaiting the arrival of Holocaust trains, were held at the Umschlagplatz overnight.[4] Other examples of Umschlagplatz include the one at Radogoszcz station - adjacent to the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto - where people were sent to Che\u0142mno extermination camp and Auschwitz.[5][6] In 1988, a memorial was erected in Warsaw to commemorate the deportation victims from the Umschlagplatz. The monument resembles a freight car with its doors open. It is located on the corner of Stawki Street.[7]",

On some days as many as 10,000 Jews were deported. An estimated 300,000 Jews were taken to the Treblinka gas chambers; some sources describe it as the largest killing of a community in World War II. The mass deportation action ended on 21 September 1942, although trains to Treblinka continued to depart from 19 April 1943 until the end of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943.[12] The Warsaw Umschlagplatz was created by fencing off a western part of the Warszawa Gda\u0144ska freight train station that was adjacent to the ghetto. The area was surrounded by a wooden fence, later replaced by a concrete wall.  Railway buildings and installations on the site, as well as a former homeless shelter and a hospital were converted into a prisoner selection facility. The rest of the train station served its normal function for the rest of the city during the deportations.",

Auschwitz, Majdanek, and Jasenovac were retrofitted with Zyklon-B gas chambers and crematoria buildings as the time went on, remaining operational until war's end in 1945.[47]",

In the early 1990s, the Jewish Holocaust organisations debated with the Polish Catholic groups about \"What religious symbols of martyrdom are appropriate as memorials in a Nazi death camp such as Auschwitz?\" The Jews opposed the placement of Christian memorials such as the Auschwitz cross near Auschwitz I where mostly Poles were killed. The Jewish victims of the Holocaust were mostly killed at Auschwitz II Birkenau.

Among such factories were the modern Hannover plant (built in 1938), M\u00fclhausen, Vienna and the factory in Pozna\u0144 (1943) and Herbst (1944). AFA's factory in Viennese borough of Schwechat was one of the sub-camps of the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. The factory was destroyed by an RAF Bomber Command air raid on 2 December 1944 [1]. It provided batteries for, among others, the German U-Boats and Panzer tanks.",

This agency was in charge of the traffic of goods entering and leaving the ghetto.

In December 1941, similar vans, using exhaust fumes rather than bottled gas, were introduced into the camp at Che\u0142mno,[267] Victims were asphyxiated while being driven to prepared burial pits in the nearby forests.[285] The vans were also used in the occupied Soviet Union, for example in smaller clearing actions in the Minsk ghetto,[286] and in Yugoslavia.[287] Apparently, as with the mass shootings, the vans caused emotional problems for the operators, and the small number of victims the vans could handle made them ineffective.[288]",

He wanted to restrict non-Germans in the conquered territories to an elementary-school education that would teach them how to write their names, count up to 500, work hard, and obey Germans.[415] The Polish political class became the target of a campaign of murder (Intelligenzaktion and AB-Aktion).[416] Between 1.8 and 1.9\u00a0million non-Jewish Polish citizens were killed by Germans during the war; about four-fifths were ethnic Poles and the rest Ukrainians and Belarusians.[406] At least 200,000 died in concentration camps, around 146,000 in Auschwitz.

The camps responsible for the killing of nearly 2,700,000 Jews were soon closed. Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka were dismantled and ploughed over before spring.[97] The operation was followed by the single largest German massacre of Jews in the entire war carried out on 3 November 1943; with approximately 43,000 prisoners shot one-by-one simultaneously in three nearby locations by the Reserve Police Battalion 101 hand-in-hand with the Trawniki men from Ukraine.[98] Auschwitz alone had enough capacity to fulfill the Nazis' remaining extermination needs.[82]",

At the time, the Red Cross justified its inaction by suggesting that aiding Jewish prisoners would harm its ability to help other Allied POWs. In addition, the Red Cross claimed that if it would take a major stance to improve the situation of those European Jews, the neutrality of Switzerland, where the International Red Cross was based, would be jeopardized. Today, the Red Cross acknowledges its passivity during the Holocaust and has apologized for this.[70]",

Surviving eyewitnesses, Mrs. Levitski and Mr. Eidman, reported cases of dismemberment and decapitation of the victims.[3] Afterwards, a Jewish Ghetto Police was set up, headed by Hermann Stahl.[5] Jews were ordered to hand\u2013over their furs, radios, silver and gold.[17]",

The only clue to her name comes from a note copied into the diary, which reads \"Dear Esterka and Minia.\" Although the exact identity of the author is unknown, a great deal can be gleaned from her writings. Her family, all of whom were employed in the workshops, including her parents, 17-year old sister, and 16-year-old brother, are mentioned. The fact that the writer does not work perhaps indicates that she is the youngest member of her family. The diary is written in Polish, confirming that the author is either from Lodz or one of the surrounding villages. The entries, dated between late February and March 1942, reveal the author's daily life and focus primarily on the two overriding themes of ghetto life, hunger and deportations.",

Brihah (the Hebrew word for \"flight, escape\") was the name given to the postwar, organized illegal emigration from eastern Europe into the Allied-occupied zones and Palestine or Israel. The Origins of Brihah The clandestine movement of Jews out of Poland to the west had its roots in a conference organized by young Polish Zionists in Lublin in late 1944, following the Soviet liberation of the city. Abba Kovner, partisan and poet, was one of the early leaders of this loose organization that at first had nothing to do with the Jewish authorities in Palestine. Members of the Zionist organizations smuggled thousands of Jews across the Polish borders with Czechoslovakia and Hungary (across the Tatra Mountains from Upper Silesia to Prague and Budapest) and moved them into displaced persons camps in Germany, Austria, and Italy. The Logistics of the Operation Officers of the Jewish Brigade of the British army assumed control of the operation, along with operatives from the Hagana (the Jewish clandestine army in Palestine) who hoped to smuggle as many displaced persons as possible into Palestine through Italy. The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee funded the operation.",

US zone commanders, and Czechoslovak officials, tacitly permitted the infiltration. How Many People Left through the Brihah Movement? Figures from the Brihah organization suggest that between August 1945 and the end of June 1946 (before the mass movement following the Kielce pogrom) over 48,000 Jews left Poland in this manner. After July 1946, at least 90,000 more Jews left Poland. The total number is not known with certainty, but it is likely that at least 150,000 Jews reached displaced persons camp (and, subsequently, Palestine or Israel) with the help of the Brihah movement.",

On the eve of the war there were 223,000 Jews in Lodz out of a population of 665,000. German troops occupied Lodz one week after Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. Lodz was annexed to Germany as part of the Warthegau. The Germans renamed the city Litzmannstadt, after a German general, Karl Litzmann, who had captured the city during World War I. In early February 1940, the Germans established a ghetto in the northeastern section of Lodz. About 160,000 Jews, more than a third of the city's population, were forced into a small area.",

The increasing emphasis on the use of concentration camp prisoners in armaments production led to the expansion of the Gross-Rosen camp, which became the center of an industrial complex and the administrative hub of a vast network of at least 97 subcamps. As of January 1, 1945, the Gross-Rosen complex held 76,728 prisoners. Nearly 26,000 of these were women, most of them Jews. This was one of the largest groupings of female prisoners in the entire concentration camp system.",

This move was unpopular with many Germans who supported Hitler but resented the fact that Poland had received the former German provinces of West Prussia, Poznan, and Upper Silesia under the Treaty of Versailles. However, Hitler sought the non-aggression pact in order to neutralize the possibility of a French-Polish military alliance against Germany before Germany had a chance to rearm. Appeasement in Europe In the mid and late 1930s, France and especially Britain followed a foreign policy of appeasement, a policy closely associated with British prime minister Neville Chamberlain. The objective of this policy was to maintain peace in Europe by making limited concessions to German demands. In Britain, public opinion tended to favor some revision of the territorial and military provisions of the Versailles treaty. Moreover, neither Britain nor France felt militarily prepared to fight a war against Nazi Germany in 1938.",

The majority, rejected as unfit for work, were deported to Belzec and killed or were shot at the Piaski ravine, just north of the camp. In the summer and fall of 1942, thousands of Jews (mainly from the Lvov ghetto) were deported to Janowska and killed. The evacuation of the Janowska camp began in November 1943. As the Germans attempted to destroy the traces of mass murder (Aktion 1005), they forced the prisoners to open the mass graves and burn the bodies. On November 19, 1943, these prisoners staged an uprising and a mass escape attempt. A few succeeded in escaping, but most were recaptured and killed. The SS staff and their local auxiliaries murdered at least 6,000 surviving Jews from various forced-labor camps in Galicia when the Janowska camp was liquidated in November 1943.",

Although the Jewish community delivered the ransom in late September 1943, the Germans still planned to deport Rome's Jews. The SS confiscated the registry of Roman Jews, which had been kept by the Jewish community at Rome's main synagogue, and deportations began in mid-October 1943. Wherever they lived, Jews were seized by the SS and taken to a military college in the center of Rome. After several days, the SS deported more than 1,000 Jews to the Auschwitz-Birkenau killing center. Subsequent roundups resulted in the arrest and deportation to Auschwitz of about another 800 Roman Jews. Almost all were killed in Auschwitz.",

Heydrich informed the representatives of various German governmental agencies that he had been tasked with the preparation of the \u201cFinal Solution.\u201d He indicated that it would affect some 11 million Jews then living in Europe. By this stage, almost one million Jews in the occupied Soviet Union had been murdered, most of the Jews in Serbia eliminated, and the first killing center established in Chelmno.",

Alongside the hunger, crowding, and constant distress, Jews in the Warsaw ghetto managed to live a rich spiritual life. Without the Oneg Shabbat archive, we would know little about this life.

And by the same token, I couldn\u2019t imagine that I wouldn\u2019t see my mother again, so that was another thing. Hiding from the real possibility of what happened. I felt that way right along, you know? I knew I didn\u2019t know. I knew what I didn\u2019t know. I really realized, but I didn\u2019t want to know.",
