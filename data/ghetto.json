As of 15 July 1941 all Jews were ordered to wear a yellow badge on their outer garments under penalty of death, and on 20 July 1941 the creation of the Minsk Ghetto was pronounced.[4] Within two years, it became the largest ghetto in German-occupied Soviet Union,[7] with over 100,000 Jews.[4]",

The Germans determined the identities of the Jews either through registration, or by issuing decrees. The Jews were separated from the general population and confined to makeshift ghettos. Because the Soviet leadership fled from Minsk without ordering evacuation, most Jewish inhabitants have been captured.[8][9] There were 100,000 prisoners held in the Minsk Ghetto, in Bobruisk 25,000, in Vitebsk 20,000, in Mogilev 12,000, in Gomel over 10,000, in Slutsk 10,000, in Borisov 8,000, and in Polotsk 8,000.[10] In the Gomel Region alone, twenty ghettos were established in which no less than 21,000 people were imprisoned.[8]",

Once beyond Minsk, 6,624 Jews were taken by lorries to the nearby village of Tuchinka (Tuchinki) and shot by members of Einsatzgruppe A.[11] The next group of over 5,000 Jews followed them to Tuchinka on 20 November 1941.[12]",

Initially, they were to be expelled to the Generalgouvernement.[33][34] However, the ultimate destination for the massive removal of Jews was left open until the Final Solution was set in motion two years later.[35]",

Five transports with five thousand Jews departed from Prague on 16, 21, 26 and 30 October and 3 November, arriving in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a the next day.[75][76] One transport, on 16 November, took Jews from Brno to Minsk.[77] Unlike later transports, the passenger list had been drawn up by the Gestapo.[75] Most of the deportees to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a were elderly, and by April 1942 sixteen percent had already died.[78] That month, Heinrich Himmler ordered the murder of 10,000 of the remaining Austrian, German, and Czech deportees: between 4 and 15 May, 10,993 Jews were deported in Kulmhof.[79] Only 277 of the Czech deportees survived the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto and subsequent deportations to extermination camps.[80]",

In smaller towns, ghettos often served as staging points for Jewish slave-labor and mass deportation actions, while in the urban centers they resembled walled-off prison-islands described by some historians as little more than instruments of \"slow, passive murder\", with dead bodies littering the streets.[4] In most cases, the larger ghettos did not correspond to traditional Jewish neighborhoods, and non-Jewish Poles and members of other ethnic groups were ordered to take up residence elsewhere. Smaller Jewish communities with populations under 500 were terminated through expulsion soon after the invasion.[5][6]",

Between October 1940 and May 1942, the first 4,000 Jews were deported. In May 1942 additional 2,000 and in August, 5,000 more. Deportations between August 1942 and mid June 1943 amounted to additional 5,000. On 22 June 1943 the next transport of 5,000 Jews departed to Auschwitz, and finally, between 1\u20133 August 1943, the remaining 8,000 were sent away. The dispersed Jews who stayed, amounting to 1,000 persons, were deported between early October 1943 and July 1944. In total, about 28,000 Jews are believed to have been deported from the B\u0119dzin Ghetto. This information however, is not confirmed by the two main sources of the remaining data nor the Jewish Historical Institute, listing only 7,000 victims.",

Daugavpils is the second largest city in Latvia and the principal city of the Latgalia region. Daugavpils was located in southeastern Latvia on the Daugava River. The city was militarily important as a major road and railway junction. Before World War II, Daugavpils was the center of a thriving Jewish community in the Latgale region and one of the most important centers of Jewish culture in eastern Europe.[1] Over the course of the German occupation of Latvia, the vast majority of the Jews of Latgale were killed as a result of the Nazi extermination policy.",

He remained silently in that position for a short time (half a minute), surrounded by a large group of dignitaries and press photographers.[2] l Brandt had actively resisted the early Nazi regime, and had spent most of the time of Hitler's reign in exile. The occasion of Brandt's visit to Poland at the time was the signing of the Treaty of Warsaw between West Germany and Poland, guaranteeing German acceptance of the new borders of Poland. The treaty was one of the Brandt-initiated policy steps (the 'Ostpolitik') to ease tensions between West and East during the Cold War.",

Ehrlinger's work was continued by Joachim Hamann, who was liable for the killing of 9012 Jews in the city and in southern Latgale.

Until 1972, when I retired from the army, I did my best to keep the place neat.[37] Independent Latvia[edit] In Latvia, Holocaust scholarship could only be resumed once Soviet rule had ended.[40]  Much of the post-1991 work was devoted to identification of the victims.[41]  This was complicated by the passage of time and the loss of some records and the concealment of others by the NKVD and its successor agencies of the Soviet secret police.[41] On November 29, 2002, sixty-one years after the murders, the highest officials of the Republic of Latvia, together with representatives of the Latvian Jewish community, foreign ambassadors, and others attended a memorial dedication at the Rumbula site.

Established in 1942 and led by Abraham Sutzkever and Shmerke Kaczerginski, the group smuggled books, paintings and sculptures past Nazi guards and hid them in various locations in and around the Ghetto. After the Ghetto's liquidation, surviving members of the group fled to join the Jewish partisans, eventually returning to Vilna following its liberation by Soviet forces. Recovered works were used to establish the Vilna Jewish Museum and then smuggled to the United States, where YIVO had re-established itself during the 1940s. Caches of hidden material continued to be discovered in Vilna into the early 1990s. Despite losses during both the Nazi and Soviet eras, 30\u201340 percent of the YIVO archive was preserved, which now represents \"the largest collection of material about Jewish life in Eastern Europe that exists in the world\".[1]",

Only 5,000 Jews were removed, instead of the 8,000 planned by Globocnik.  Hundreds of people in the Warsaw Ghetto were ready to fight, adults and children, sparsely armed with handguns, gasoline bottles, and a few other weapons that had been smuggled into the ghetto by resistance fighters.[3] Most of the Jewish fighters did not view their actions as an effective measure by which to save themselves, but rather as a battle for the honour of the Jewish people, and a protest against the world's silence.[16]",

Ghetto diarist Emmanuel Ringelblum speculated that Romani were sent to the Warsaw Ghetto because the Germans wanted:...\u00a0to toss into the Ghetto everything that is characteristically dirty, shabby, bizarre, of which one ought to be frightened, and which anyway has to be destroyed.[33] Initially, there was disagreement within the Nazi circles about how to solve the \"Gypsy Question\".  In late 1939 and early 1940, Hans Frank, the General Governor of occupied Poland, refused to accept the 30,000 German and Austrian Roma which were to be deported to his territory.  Heinrich Himmler \"lobbied to save a handful of pure-blooded Roma\", whom he believed to be an ancient Aryan people for his \"ethnic reservation\", but was opposed by Martin Bormann, who favored deportation for all Roma.[18]  The debate ended in 1942 when Himmler signed the order to begin the mass deportations of Roma to Auschwitz concentration camp. During Operation Reinhard (1941\u201343), an undetermined number of Roma were killed in the extermination camps, such as Treblinka.[34]",

The largest collection point was in Warsaw next to the Warsaw Ghetto. In 1942 between 254,000 \u2013 265,000 Jews passed through the Warsaw Umschlagplatz on their way to the Treblinka extermination camp during Operation Reinhard,[1] the deadliest phase of the Holocaust in Poland.[2][3] Often those awaiting the arrival of Holocaust trains, were held at the Umschlagplatz overnight.[4] Other examples of Umschlagplatz include the one at Radogoszcz station - adjacent to the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto - where people were sent to Che\u0142mno extermination camp and Auschwitz.[5][6] In 1988, a memorial was erected in Warsaw to commemorate the deportation victims from the Umschlagplatz.

On some days as many as 10,000 Jews were deported. An estimated 300,000 Jews were taken to the Treblinka gas chambers; some sources describe it as the largest killing of a community in World War II. The mass deportation action ended on 21 September 1942, although trains to Treblinka continued to depart from 19 April 1943 until the end of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943.[12] The Warsaw Umschlagplatz was created by fencing off a western part of the Warszawa Gda\u0144ska freight train station that was adjacent to the ghetto. The area was surrounded by a wooden fence, later replaced by a concrete wall.  Railway buildings and installations on the site, as well as a former homeless shelter and a hospital were converted into a prisoner selection facility. The rest of the train station served its normal function for the rest of the city during the deportations.",

Surviving eyewitnesses, Mrs. Levitski and Mr. Eidman, reported cases of dismemberment and decapitation of the victims.[3] Afterwards, a Jewish Ghetto Police was set up, headed by Hermann Stahl.[5] Jews were ordered to hand\u2013over their furs, radios, silver and gold.[17]",

The majority, rejected as unfit for work, were deported to Belzec and killed or were shot at the Piaski ravine, just north of the camp. In the summer and fall of 1942, thousands of Jews (mainly from the Lvov ghetto) were deported to Janowska and killed. The evacuation of the Janowska camp began in November 1943. As the Germans attempted to destroy the traces of mass murder (Aktion 1005), they forced the prisoners to open the mass graves and burn the bodies. On November 19, 1943, these prisoners staged an uprising and a mass escape attempt. A few succeeded in escaping, but most were recaptured and killed. The SS staff and their local auxiliaries murdered at least 6,000 surviving Jews from various forced-labor camps in Galicia when the Janowska camp was liquidated in November 1943.",

On June 22, 1941, Germany attacked Soviet forces in eastern Europe. The German army occupied Vilna on June 24, 1941, the third day after the invasion. Vilna Ghetto In July 1941, the German military administration issued a series of anti-Jewish decrees. During the same month, German Einsatzgruppen (mobile killing squads) aided by Lithuanian auxiliaries killed 5,000 Jewish men at Ponary forest, eight miles outside Vilna. A German civilian administration took control of Vilna in August 1941. At the end of the month, Germans killed another 3,500 Jews at Ponary.",

Lukiszki Prison served as a collection center for Jews who were to be taken to Ponary and shot. By the end of 1941, the Einsatzgruppen had killed about 40,000 Jews in Ponary. The Jews in ghetto # 1 were forced to work in factories or in construction projects outside the ghetto. Some Jews were sent to labor camps in the Vilna region. In periodic killing operations, most of the ghetto's inhabitants were massacred at Ponary. From the spring of 1942 until the spring of 1943, there were no mass killing operations in Vilna. The Germans renewed the killings during the final liquidation of ghetto # 1 in late September 1943. Children, the elderly, and the sick were sent to the Sobibor killing center or were shot at Ponary.
