The local Gestapo commander was Rudolf Kerner, and it was he who determined who should be heard. During the war was about 3,500 Norwegians from S\u00f8rlandet arrested on of more than four days. Over 400 were tortured by the German security police and Gestapo, and 162 died in concentration camps or were executed. One of the tortured was resistance fighter Louis Hogganvik. \"Horror house\" as the nickname was of Arkivet, is today the only surviving Gestapo headquarters in  Norway, and appears almost authentic. Kerner was in charge of several  German security police actions at S\u00f8rlandet in World War II together with the Norwegian Statspolitiet .",

In March 1935, 55 priests were arrested. The Confessing Church maintained a preachers' seminar headed by Dietrich Bonhoeffer in Zingst, which moved to Finkenwalde in 1935 and to Koslin and Gross Schlonwitz in 1940. Within the Catholic Church, the most prominent resistance member was Greifswald priest Alfons Wachsmann, who was executed in 1944. After the failed assassination attempt of Hitler on July 20, 1944, Gestapo arrested thirteen Pomeranian nobles and one burgher, all knight estate owners. Of those, Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin had contacted Winston Churchill in 1938 to inform about the work of the German opposition to the Nazis, and was executed in April 1945. Karl von Zitzewitz had connections to the Kreisauer Kreis group. Among the other arrested were Malte von Veltheim Furst zu Putbus, who died in a concentration camp, as well as Alexander von Kameke and Oscar Caminecci-Zettuhn, who both were executed.",

The principal perpetrators of these war crimes were the Nazi collaborationist S.S. Sturmbrigade R.O.N.A., the so-called \"Russian National Liberation Army\" , commanded by Bronislav Kaminski. The worst atrocities were committed in the local hospitals, in the Curie Institute, the Kolonia Staszica housing estate, and the Zieleniak concentration camp.

        "The press  Fritz Gerlich, editor of Munich's Catholic weekly, was murdered during the Night of the Long Knives. Germany's Catholic press faced censorship and closure. In March 1941, Joseph Goebbels banned the church press due to a \"paper shortage\". In 1933, the Nazis established a Reich Chamber of Authorship and a Reich Press Chamber under the Reich Cultural Chamber of the Ministry for Propaganda. Dissident writers were terrorized, and the 1934 Night of the Long Knives was the culmination of this early campaign. Fritz Gerlich, editor of Munich's Catholic weekly Der Gerade Weg, was killed for his criticism of the Nazis; writer and theologian Dietrich von Hildebrand was forced to flee Germany. Poet Ernst Wiechert protested government attitudes toward the arts, calling them \"spiritual murder\"; he was arrested and interned at Dachau. Hundreds of arrests and the closure of Catholic presses followed Mit brennender Sorge, Pius XI's anti-Nazi encyclical. Nikolaus Gross, a Christian trade unionist and journalist, was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 2001. Declared an enemy of the state in 1938, his newspaper was shut down. Gross was arrested as part of the 20 July plot roundup, and was executed on 23 January 1945.",

In some cases, inmates were immediately killed upon acknowledging Serbian ethnicity, and most considered it to be the sole reason for their imprisonment. The Serbs were predominantly brought from the Kozara region, where the Usta\u0161e captured areas that were held by Partisan guerrillas. These were brought to the camp without sentence, almost destined for immediate execution, accelerated via the use of machine-guns. The exact number of Serbian casualties in Jasenovac is uncertain, but the lowest common estimates range around 60,000 people, and is one of the most significant parts of overall Serbian casualties of World War II.",

Along with the rest of the region, was occupied by Nazi Germany. The Einsatzkommando 16 entered the town to commit various crimes against Poles. From mid-September 1939, Germans carried out mass arrests of Poles from the town and county, who were initially imprisoned in the local courthouse, and after its overcrowding, they were deported to a temporary camp established in the nearby village of Radzim. Some Poles were executed in Radzim, but more were murdered in Rudzki Most , where Germans carried out large massacres of Poles in October and November 1939, killing several hundreds people. Among Poles massacred in Rudzki Most were teachers, school principals, merchants, craftsmen and local officials from Tuchola, including mayor Stanislaw Saganowski, as well as farmers, priests, foresters, postmen, railwaymen, merchants, craftsmen and policemen from nearby villages. After the German defeat, the town reverted to Poland.",

While confined to the Vilna Ghetto, he organized and oversaw the creation and operation of a library in the Ghetto. He also played an active role in several of the ghetto's social welfare and cultural organizations. Kruk continued chronicling his experiences after he was transferred to the Klooga concentration camp.  The last entry was made on September 17, 1944, when he buried his diaries inside the camp at KZ Lagedi in Estonia. The following day, he and almost all the other prisoners were forced to carry logs to a pile, spread them in a layer, lie down naked on them so they could be executed and burned in a massive pyre. The Red Army arrived the following day to find the aftermath. His diary was published posthumously in 1961 by YIVO in original Yiddish . Expanded English translation, The Last Days of the Jerusalem of Lithuania: Chronicles from the Vilna Ghetto and the Camps 1939-1944, was published in 2002 .

Lwow capitulated on 22 September because of the Soviet intervention; the city had been attacked by the Germans over a week earlier, and in the middle of the siege, the German troops handed operations over to their Soviet allies. Despite a series of intensifying German attacks, Warsaw, sefended by quickly-reorganized retreating units, civilian volunteers and militias, held out until 28 September. The Modlin Fortress north of Warsaw capitulated on 29 September, after an intense 16-day battle. Some isolated Polish garrisons managed to hold their positions long after they had been surrounded by German forces. The enclave of Westerplatte s tiny garrison capitulated on 7 September and the Oksywie garrison held until 19 September; the Hel Fortified Area was defended until 2 October.

He is best known as the author of a monumental monograph of the Gusen part of the former Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. Born in Makow Mazowiecki, Dobosiewicz became a lyceum teacher in the interbellum. Arrested in April 1940, in the course of the AB Action, he was sent to Dachau concentration camp and then to KL Gusen, where he spent the entire war. After the war, he resumed his teaching career and became one of the prominent members of the Polish section of the Mauthausen-Gusen Club of former inmates of that camp. He also started gathering materials for his future book on the camp. Eventually, he published four books on the history of the camp, each devoted to a different aspect of life there.

Operation Reinhard or Operation Reinhardt  was the codename of the secretive German plan in World War II to exterminate Polish Jews in the General Government district of German-occupied Poland. This deadliest phase of the Holocaust was marked by the introduction of extermination camps. As many as two million Jews were sent to Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka to be put to death in purpose-built gas chambers. In addition, mass-killing facilities, using Zyklon B, were developed at about the same time at the Majdanek concentration camp and at Auschwitz II-Birkenau, near the earlier-established Auschwitz I camp for ethnically Polish prisoners.",

        "Alliance with Germany As war approached in 1939, the Fascist regime stepped up an aggressive press campaign against France claiming that Italian people were suffering in France. This was important to the alliance as both regimes mutually had claims on France, Germany on German-populated Alsace-Lorraine and Italy on Italian-populated Corsica, Nizza and Savoia. In May 1939, a formal alliance was organized. The alliance was known as the Pact of Steel, which obliged Italy to fight alongside Germany if war broke out against Germany. Mussolini felt obliged to sign the pact in spite of his own concerns that Italy could not fight a war in the near future. This obligation grew from his promises to Italians that he would build an empire for them and from his personal desire to not allow Hitler to become the dominant leader in Europe. Mussolini was repulsed by the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact agreement where Germany and the Soviet Union agreed to partition the Second Polish Republic into German and Soviet zones for an impending invasion. The Fascist government saw this as a betrayal of the Anti-Comintern Pact, but decided to remain officially silent.",

        "^ In October and November 1943 the Germans began concentrating Jews in transit camps in major cities, including Florence, Genoa, Milan, Rome, and Trieste. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, \"these operations had limited success, due in part to advance warning given to the Jews by Italian authorities and the Vatican, and in part to the unwillingness of many non-Jewish Italians, including Salo police authorities, to participate in or facilitate the roundups.\u00a0... In all, the Germans deported 8,564 Jews from Italy, Italian-occupied France, and the islands of Rhodes and Kos, most of them to Auschwitz-Birkenau. 1,009 returned. In addition, the Germans shot 196 Jews in Italy proper, nearly half of these at the Ardeatine Caves in March 1944. Another approximately 100 died in the police transit camps or in prisons or police custody through Italy. More than 40,000 Jews survived the Holocaust in Italy.\"",

In 1919, the town, being part of the continuous German Sprachraum, was proclaimed part of the Republic of German-Austria, but shortly afterwards became part of the First Czechoslovak Republic. From 1938 to 1945 it was one of the municipalities in Sudetenland. During World War II, Falkenau was the site of a sub-camp of the Flossenburg Concentration Camp. The camp at Falkenau was captured by the U.S. 1st Infantry Division on May 6, 1945. Nearly all of the town's population, being Germans, were expelled after 1945. It was renamed Sokolov in 1948 in honour of the Battle of Sokolovo in which Czechoslovak soldiers had fought alongside Soviet soldiers on the Eastern Front in World War II.",

        "Act V Riccardo dons the yellow star and joins deportees to die at Auschwitz, where the rest of the act takes place.  He is confronted by the Doctor, who is otherwise not named but closely resembles Josef Mengele. The Doctor is a nihilist to whom \"Auschwitz refutes creator, creation and the creature. . . cursed is he who creates life. I cremate life\"  He takes Riccardo under his protection, hoping that the church will help him escape the hangman after Germany loses the war. Gerstein appears at the camp in an unsanctioned attempt to rescue Riccardo. Unfortunately in the end they are found out, and Riccardo momentarily loses in faith and violates his vow not to take up arms in order to shoot the maleficent Doctor, but is himself gunned down before he can pull the trigger. Gerstein is taken into custody, and Riccardo follows in a long tradition of tragic figures by showing himself partly redeemed with his dying declaration, a whispered \"'in hora mortis meae voca me'\"   In either case, Riccardo does not die entirely confident of salvation, which would lessen his status as a tragic hero. The play ends with a quotation from German ambassador Weizsacker:",

I will avoid the story of how this came to be, but, yes, you guessed it, it was the Zionists\". Roberts added that \"No German plans, or orders from Hitler, or from Himmler or anyone else have ever been found for an organized holocaust by gas and cremation of Jews...

        "Overview The euthanasia centre was located in Brandenburg an der Havel in the old gaol in Neuendorfer Strasse 90c. Brandenburg Concentration Camp was housed in these buildings from August 1933 to February 1934. A concentration camp, one of the first in Germany, was located on Neuendorfer Strasse in Brandenburg Old Town. After closing this inner city concentration camp, the Nazis used the Brandenburg-Gorden Prison, located in Gorden, a suburb of Brandenburg. Later the old gaol became the Brandenburg Euthanasia Centre where the Nazis killed people with mental problems, including children. They called this operation \"Action T4\" because of the Berlin address, Tiergartenstrasse 4, the headquarters of this planned and well-organized killing \"euthanasia\" organisation. Brandenburg an der Havel was one of the first locations in the Third Reich where the Nazis experimented with killing their victims by gas. This was a foreshadow for the mass killings in Auschwitz and other extermination camps. After complaints by local inhabitants about the smoke, the mobile furnaces used to burn the corpses ceased operation. Shortly after this, the Nazis closed the old prison.",

        "War years Following the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1939, deportations of Jewish families began in August 1941. The Hermanns were sent in 1942 to Terezin; in 1944 they were transferred to Auschwitz and separated. Paul Hermann died in 1945 on a forced march, not long before the end of the Second World War. Helen, who survived two \"selections\" by Dr Josef Mengele, was later sent to Stutthof concentration camp in northern Poland. When the war ended, she returned to Prague, where she learnt of her husband's death; her mother, who had been deported early in 1942, had died at Sobibor extermination camp. Helen began to correspond with Harry Lewis, a Czech with British nationality whom she had known at school and with whom she had had a brief romance before she met Hermann. She married Lewis in Prague in the summer of 1947 and in October moved to Belfast.",

        "Ghettos and death camps The German Nazis established six extermination camps throughout occupied Poland by 1942. All of these \u2013 at Chelmno , Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka, Majdanek and Auschwitz  \u2013 were located near the rail network so that the victims could be easily transported. The system of the camps was expanded over the course of the German occupation of Poland and their purposes were diversified; some served as transit camps, some as forced labor camps and the majority as death camps. While in the death camps, the victims were usually killed shortly after arrival, in the other camps able-bodied Jews were worked and beaten to death. The operation of concentration camps depended on Kapos, the collaborator-prisoners. Some of them were Jewish themselves, and their prosecution after the war created an ethical dilemma.",

By 1944, he had been imprisoned in a concentration camp by the Nazis, and he was outraged to be put on trial as a major war criminal.",

        "World War II Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939 starting World War II in Europe. ZG\u00a076 had been stationed at the Polish border prior to the invasion. Gollob scored the first of his aerial victories over Poland on 5 September 1939, shooting down a PWS\u00a056  biplane. He also flew ground support missions, attacking an airfield and destroying several aircraft on the ground. On 21 September 1939, Gollob was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class. Following the campaign in Poland, ZG\u00a076 was moved to Germany for defensive operations. The 1. Gruppe of ZG\u00a076 first relocated to the Stuttgart area on 29 September 1939 to defend the western border against the French and British, who had declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939. From early October to mid-December, I. Gruppe operated from airfields in the Stuttgart and Ruhr regions before relocating north to Jever on 16 December 1939. There, on 18 December 1939, Gollob claimed his second aerial victory over a Royal Air Force  Vickers Wellington bomber in what became known as the Battle of the Heligoland Bight. During the battle, he shot down and killed Squadron Leader Archibald Guthrie, of No. 9 Squadron.",

After the end of the war, the stab-in-the-back myth alleged that internal enemies, including Jews, were responsible for Germany's defeat. In Stalin's Soviet Union, the statewide campaign against \"rootless cosmopolitans\" \u2013 a euphemism for Jews \u2013 was set out on 28 January 1949 with an article in the newspaper Pravda:",

        "Liberation  Prisoner of KZ Buchenwald with member of SS personnel after entry of U.S. Army 1945.  U.S. Senator Alben W. Barkley  looks on after Buchenwald's liberation. On April 4, 1945, the U.S. 89th Infantry Division overran Ohrdruf, a subcamp of Buchenwald. Buchenwald was partially evacuated by the Germans from April 6, 1945, until April 11, 1945. In the days before the arrival of the American army, thousands of the prisoners were forced to join the evacuation marches. Thanks in large part to the efforts of Polish engineer  Gwidon Damazyn, an inmate since March 1941, a secret short-wave transmitter and small generator were built and hidden in the prisoners' movie room. On April 8 at noon, Damazyn and Russian prisoner Konstantin Ivanovich Leonov sent the Morse code message prepared by leaders of the prisoners' underground resistance :",

        "Battle of Bir Hakeim  The FFF's tenacious defence at Bir Hakeim prevented Rommel's attempted flanking manoeuvre at El Alamein from succeeding. Throughout 1942 in North Africa, British Empire forces fought a desperate land campaign against the Germans and Italians to prevent the loss of Egypt and the vital Suez canal. Here, fighting in the harsh Libyan desert, Free French soldiers distinguished themselves. General Marie Pierre Koenig and his unit\u2014the 1st Free French Infantry Brigade\u2014resisted the Afrika Korps at the Battle of Bir Hakeim in June 1942, although they were eventually obliged to withdraw, as Allied forces retreated to El Alamein, their lowest ebb in the North African campaign. Koenig defended Bir Hakeim from 26 May to 11 June against superior German and Italian forces led by Generaloberst Erwin Rommel, proving that the FFF could be taken seriously by the Allies as a fighting force. British General Claude Auchinleck said on 12 June 1942, of the battle: \"The United Nations need to be filled with admiration and gratitude, in respect of these French troops and their brave General Koenig\". Even Hitler was impressed, announcing to the journalist Lutz Koch, recently returned from Bir Hakeim:",

        "Political and religious opponents Main articles: German resistance to Nazism, Religion in Nazi Germany, and Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Nazi Germany German communists, socialists and trade unionists were among the earliest opponents of the Nazis and among the first to be sent to concentration camps. Nacht und Nebel , a directive issued by Hitler on 7 December 1941, resulted in the disappearance,  torture and death of political activists throughout German-occupied Europe; the courts had sentenced 1,793 people to death by April 1944, according to Jack Fischel. Because they refused to pledge allegiance to the Nazi party or serve in the military, Jehovah's Witnesses were sent to concentration camps, where they were identified by purple triangles and given the option of renouncing their faith and submitting to the state's authority. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum estimates that between 2,700 and 3,300 were sent to the camps, where 1,400 died. According to German historian Detlef Garbe, \"no other religious movement resisted the pressure to conform to National Socialism with comparable unanimity and steadfastness.\"",

        "Imprisonment  Hallway in the preserved bunker at Dachau concentration camp, 2008 Elser never faced a trial for the bombing of the Burgerbraukeller. After his year of torment at Berlin Gestapo Headquarters, he was kept in special custody in Sachsenhausen concentration camp between early 1941 and early 1945. At Sachsenhausen, Elser was held in isolation in a T-shaped building reserved for protected prisoners. Accommodated in three cells joined together, each 9.35\u00a0m2, there was space for his two full-time guards and a work space to make furniture and other things, including several zithers. Elser's apparent preferential treatment, which included extra rations and daily visits to the camp barber for a shave, aroused interest amongst other prisoners, including British SIS officer Payne Best. He wrote later that Elser was also allowed regular visits to the camp brothel. Martin Niemoller was also a special inmate in the Sachsenhausen \"bunker\" and believed the rumours that Elser was an SS man and an agent of Hitler and Himmler. Elser kept a photo of Elsa Harlen in his cell. In early 1945, Elser was transferred to the bunker at Dachau concentration camp.",

Payments amounted to 400,000 Reichstaler, or one million livres per year, plus an additional 120,000 Reichstalers for 1630. While less than 2% of the total French state budget, it made up over 25% of the Swedish, and allowed Gustavus to support an army of 36,000. He won major victories at Breitenfeld in September 1631, then Rain in April 1632, where Tilly was killed. After Tilly's death, Ferdinand turned once again to Wallenstein; knowing Gustavus was over extended, he marched into Franconia and established himself at Furth, threatening the Swedish supply chain. In late August, Gustavus incurred heavy losses in an unsuccessful assault on the town, arguably the greatest blunder in his German campaign. Two months later, the Swedes won a resounding victory at Lutzen, where Gustavus was killed. Rumours now began circulating Wallenstein was preparing to switch sides, and in February 1634, Ferdinand issued orders for his arrest; on 25th, he was assassinated by one of his officers in Cheb.",

        "Resistance organization As early as 15 May 1940, the day after the Dutch capitulation, the Communist Party of the Netherlands  held a meeting to organize their underground existence and resistance against the German occupiers. It was the first resistance organization in the country. As a result, some 2,000 communists were to lose their lives in torture rooms, concentration camps or by firing squad. On the same day Bernardus IJzerdraat distributed leaflets protesting against the German occupation and called on the public to resist the Germans. This was the first public act of resistance. IJzerdraat started to build an illegal resistance organization called De Geuzen, named after a group who rebelled against Spanish occupation in the 16th century. A few months after the German invasion, a number of Revolutionary Socialist Worker's Party  members including Henk Sneevliet formed the Marx\u2013Lenin\u2013Luxemburg Front. Its entire leadership was caught and executed in April 1942. The CPN and the RSAP were the only pre-war organizations that went underground and protested against the antisemitic action taken by the German occupiers. According to CIA historian Stewart Bentley, there were four major resistance organizations in the country by the middle of 1944, independent of each other:",

After his arrest, eight members of Goerdeler's family were sent to the concentration camps under the Sippenhaft law. His brother Fritz was also sentenced to death and executed on 1 March 1945.

On 9 September 1944, after a trial at the People's Court, he was sentenced to death. Goerdeler was not physically tortured by the Gestapo, and freely co-operated with the Gestapo in naming names, which made him the object of a considerable hatred from the other prisoners, who saw him as a \"spineless rat.\"",

Upon discovery of the Nazi concentration camps, he ordered camera crews to document evidence of the atrocities in them for use in the Nuremberg Trials. He reclassified German prisoners of war  in U.S. custody as Disarmed Enemy Forces , who were no longer subject to the Geneva Convention. Eisenhower followed the orders laid down by the Joint Chiefs of Staff  in directive JCS 1067, but softened them by bringing in 400,000 tons of food for civilians and allowing more fraternization. In response to the devastation in Germany, including food shortages and an influx of refugees, he arranged distribution of American food and medical equipment. His actions reflected the new American attitudes of the German people as Nazi victims not villains, while aggressively purging the ex-Nazis.",

The matter is currently the topic of scholarly debate. A national commission of historians recommended by the Union of the Italian Jewish Communities, the Center for Contemporary Jewish Documentation in Milan, the Italian Ministry of the Interior and the Centro Primo Levi NY is conducting a comprehensive review of the documents.",

Sobibor was one of four extermination camps established as part of Operation Reinhard, the deadliest phase of the Holocaust. The extermination of Europe's Jews did not originate as a single top-down decision, but was rather a patchwork of decisions made regarding particular occupied areas. Following the invasion of Poland in September 1939, the Germans began implementing the Nisko Plan in which Jews were deported from ghettos across Europe to the forced labor camps which comprised the Lublin Reservation. Lublin District region was chosen in particular for its inhospitable conditions. The Nisko Plan was abandoned in 1940, but many forced labor camps continued operations in the area, including Trawniki, Lipowa 7, and Dorohucza.",

Her father was a blacksmith. In 1924, she moved to Mulheim and married Wilhelm Langefeld, who died in 1926 of lung disease. In 1928, Langefeld fell pregnant with another man, left him soon afterward, and moved to Dusseldorf, where her son was born that August. Langefeld was unemployed until age 34, when she began to teach domestic economy in an establishment of the city of Neuss. From 1935 onwards, she worked as a guard in a so-called Arbeitsanstalt  in Brauweiler, which was, in fact, a prison for prostitutes, unemployed and homeless women, and other so called \"antisocial\" women, who were then later imprisoned in concentration camps. From 1937 on, Langefeld was a member of the Nazi party.",

After the war, the neighbourhood was left deserted. Many of the houses began to deteriorate and were eventually torn down. In the 1960s, the city government unveiled plans to build a highway through the Jodenbreestraat, as well as a metro line underneath the street. To prepare for construction, Jodenbreestraat was significantly widened by tearing down the remaining houses along the north side of the street. However, following heavy riots in 1975, the highway plans were abandoned.",

        "Bundische Jugend After the First World War, the leaders returned disillusioned from the war. The same was true for leaders of German Scouting. So both movements started to influence each other heavily in Germany. From the Wandervogel came a stronger culture of hiking, adventure, bigger tours to farther places, romanticism and a younger leadership structure. Scouting brought uniforms, flags, more organisation, more camps and a clearer, more rational ideology. There was also an educationalist influence from Gustav Wyneken. Together, this led to the emergence of the Bundische Jugend, a movement of many different youth associations. There were Wandervogel groups, Scouting associations and others, all of which mixed the elements described above with new ingredients. New styles and groups developed. A new tent form, the kohte, was invented, which is still the typical black tent used by German scouts on international scout camps to this day. The Deutsche Freischar and then the Jungenschaft was founded.",

        "Biography Family Norman Finkelstein was born on December 8, 1953, in New York City, the son of Harry and Maryla Finkelstein, nee Husyt. Finkelstein's parents were Jewish. His mother grew up in Warsaw and survived the Warsaw Ghetto and the Majdanek concentration camp. His father was a survivor of both the Warsaw Ghetto and Auschwitz. After the war they met in a displaced persons camp in Linz, Austria, and then emigrated to the United States, where his father became a factory worker and his mother a homemaker and later a bookkeeper. Finkelstein's mother was an ardent pacifist. Both his parents died in 1995. Finkelstein has said that \"they saw the world through the prism of the Nazi Holocaust. They were eternally indebted to the Soviet Union , and so anyone who was anti-Soviet they were extremely harsh on\". They supported the Soviet Union's approval of the creation of the State of Israel, as enunciated by Andrei Andreyevich Gromyko, who said that Jews had earned the right to a state, but thought that Israel had sold its soul to the West and \"refused to have any truck with it\".",

        "Efforts to conceal the historical record German efforts See also: Sonderaktion 1005  Members of a Sonderkommando 1005 unit pose next to a bone-crushing machine in the Janowska concentration camp in German-occupied Poland  While the Second World War was still underway, the Nazis had already formed a contingency plan that if defeat was imminent they would carry out the total destruction of German records. Historians have documented evidence that as Germany's defeat became imminent and Nazi leaders realized they would most likely be captured and brought to trial, great effort was made to destroy all evidence of mass extermination. Heinrich Himmler instructed his camp commandants to destroy records, crematoria, and other signs of mass extermination. As one of many examples, the bodies of the 25,000 mostly Latvian Jews whom Friedrich Jeckeln and the soldiers under his command had shot at Rumbula  in late 1941 were dug up and burned in 1943. Similar operations were undertaken at Belzec, Treblinka and other death camps.",

This took place through a complex network of business interests, joint ventures, cooperation agreements, and cross-ownership between American and German corporations and their subsidiaries. Resources supplied to German companies  by American corporations included: synthetic rubber production technology  and Standard Oil of New Jersey), communication equipment , computing and tabulation machines , aviation technology , fuel , military vehicles , funding , collaboration agreements, production facilities and raw materials. DuPont owned stocks in IG Farben and Degussa AG, who controlled Degesch, the producer of Zyklon B, a chemical that was later used to murder millions of people in Nazi death camps. This involvement was motivated not only by financial gain, but in some cases by ideology as well.

        "World War II Andenaes applied to become docent in 1940 and professor in 1942, at the University of Oslo, but his candidacy was rejected both times due to the German occupation of Norway. He had participated in battles against the Wehrmacht in the Norwegian Campaign, being lightly wounded near Skarnes. During the occupation, then, he marked himself as an oppositional person at the university. When the Nazi authorities were about to change the rules for admission to the university, in autumn 1943, a protest ensued. In retaliation, the authorities arrested 11 staff, 60 male students and 10 female students. The staff Carl Jacob Arnholm, Eiliv Skard, Johan Christian Schreiner, Harald Krabbe Schjelderup, Anatol Heintz, Odd Hassel, Ragnar Frisch, Bjorn Foyn, Endre Berner and Johannes Andenaes were sent to Grini concentration camp. Andenaes was first incarcerated at Bredtveit from 15 October to 22 November, then at Berg until 8 December, then at Grini until 24 December 1944.",

Actions were started on a similar scale in other Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany. According to many historians, including Norman Davies, the action against Polish leaders was coordinated with the authorities of the Soviet Union, who at the same time perpetrated the mass murder of 22,000 Polish military officers at Katyn and other places. The active persecution of Polish intellectuals was continued until the end of the war. The direct continuation of the AB Action was a German campaign in the east started after the German invasion of the USSR. Among the most notable mass executions of Polish professors was the massacre of Lwow professors, in which approximately 45 professors of the university in Lwow were murdered together with their families and guests. Among those killed in the massacre were Tadeusz Boy-Zelenski, former Polish prime minister Kazimierz Bartel, Wlodzimierz Stozek,  and Stanislaw Ruziewicz. Thousands more perished in the Ponary massacre, in German concentration camps, and in ghettos.",

The operation was mounted against the German-held Glomfjord power plant in Norway from 11 to 21 September 1942. The raiders consisted of two officers and eight men from No. 2 Commando and two men of the Norwegian Armed Forces in exile who were part of the Special Operations Executive. Crossing the North Sea by submarine, on arrival in Norway they attacked and damaged the plant, which was closed for the rest of the war. To evade German search parties, the commandos split into two groups. One group of four men reached Sweden and were eventually repatriated to the United Kingdom. The second group was captured; one man died of wounds and the other seven were taken to Germany, interrogated and then executed at Sachsenhausen concentration camp.",

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.   The treatment of the refugees at the camps caused an international outcry after it was claimed that the conditions could be likened to German concentration camps. Dr Barou was once again on hand to witness events. He reported that conditions at Camp Poppendorf were poor and claimed that it was being run by a German camp commandant. That was denied by the British. It turned out that Barou's reports had been untrue. There was no German commandant or guards but there were German staff carrying out duties inside the camp, in accordance with the standard British military practice of using locally employed civilians for non-security related duties. But the Jewish allegations of cruel and insensitive treatment would not go away and on 6 October 1947 the Foreign Office sent a telegram to the British commanders in the region demanding to know whether the camps really were surrounded with barbed wire and guarded by German staff.",

        "Dismantling in East Germany The Soviet Union engaged in a massive industrial dismantling campaign in its occupation zone, much more intensive than that carried out by the Western powers. While the Soviet powers soon realized that their actions alienated the German workforce from the Communist cause, they decided that the desperate economic situation within the Soviet Union took priority over alliance building. The allied leaders had agreed on paper to economic and political cooperation but the issue of reparations dealt an early blow to the prospect of a united Germany in 1945. The figure of $20 Billion had been floated by Stalin as an adequate recompense but as the United States refused to consider this a basis for negotiation The Soviet Union was left only with the opportunity of extracting its own reparations, at a heavy cost to the East Germans. This was the beginning of the formal split of Germany.",

By May 1942 three ovens had been installed in crematorium I, which together could burn 340 bodies in 24 hours.

It began on 22 December 1944 when the Soviet Commander-in-Chief ordered the expulsions. Three percent of the German pre-war population  had been evacuated by the Volksbund before that. They went to Austria, but many had returned. Overall, 60,000 ethnic Germans had fled. According to the West German Schieder commission report of 1956, in early 1945 between 30\u201335,000 ethnic German civilians and 30,000 military POW were arrested and transported from Hungary to the Soviet Union as forced labourers. In some villages, the entire adult population was taken to labor camps in the Donbass. 6,000 died there as a result of hardships and ill-treatment. Data from the Russian archives, which was based on an actual enumeration, put the number of ethnic Germans registered by the Soviets in Hungary at 50,292 civilians, of whom 31,923 were deported to the USSR for reparations labor implementing the Order 7161. 9%  were documented as having died.",

        "Supreme Court of Canada case The booklet was examined by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1985 and 1988 in the prosecution of the publisher Zundel under the Criminal Code, section 181, of spreading false news. The 1985 conviction was overturned on appeal, leading to a second prosecution in 1988 which again resulted in a sentence of 15 months. As part of Zundel's legal defence, Zundel hired Fred A. Leuchter to visit the Auschwitz and Majdanek concentration camps. At the trial, Leuchter was required to defend his report in his capacity as expert witness; however, he was dismissed because during the proceedings it became apparent that he had neither the qualifications nor experience to act as such. The 1988 trial judge concluded that the booklet \"misrepresented the work of historians, misquoted witnesses, fabricated evidence, and cited non-existent authorities.\" The Supreme Court did find that in the previous lower court trial, the jury were improperly instructed:",

        "Liberation As most of the camps of the Mittelbau system were completely evacuated, there were not many prisoners left to be liberated by the Allies. Only some small subcamps, mostly containing Italian POWs, were not evacuated. The SS also left several hundred sick prisoners at Dora and in the Boelcke-Kaserne. They were freed when US troops  reached Nordhausen on 11 April 1945. There were also around 1,300 dead prisoners at the barracks. War correspondents took pictures and made films of the dead and dying prisoners at Dora. Like the documentation of Nazi atrocities at Bergen-Belsen, these were published around the globe and became some of the best-known testimonies of Nazi crimes. Most of those inmates who survived the transports were freed in mid-April at Bergen-Belsen or at other camps. Some, however, remained prisoners until early May and were freed in Mecklenburg or Austria. In total, even conservative estimates put the number of people who did not survive being sent to Mittelbau-Dora at over 20,000. Thus, around one in three of those confined here did not survive.",

The Uckermark subcamp was located about one mile from the Ravensbruck concentration camp. It was opened in May 1942 as a prison or parallel concentration camp for teenage girls aged 16 to 21 dubbed criminal or \"difficult\" by the SS. Girls who reached the upper age limit were transferred back to the Ravensbruck women's camp. Camp administration was provided by the Ravensbruck main camp. In January 1945, the prison for juveniles was closed although the gassing infrastructure was subsequently used for the extermination of \"sick, no longer efficient, and over 52 years old women\" from Ravensbruck .",

In 1940, during the Nazi Occupation of Poland, German authorities established a Jewish ghetto in Lowicz, in order to confine its Jewish population for the purpose of persecution and exploitation. The ghetto was liquidated in March 1941, when all its 8,000\u20138,200 inhabitants were transported in cattle trucks to Warsaw Ghetto, the largest ghetto in all of Nazi occupied Europe with over 400,000 Jews crammed into an area of 1.3 square miles .

        "Precursor to the \"Final Solution\" In addition, in summer 1941 more than one thousand inmates from concentration camps were executed at Pirna-Sonnenstein as part of Action 14f13. At the time the camps did not have their own gas chambers. The scale of prisoner transportation to Sonnenstein is still not fully known. Records show transportations from the concentration camps of Sachsenhausen, Buchenwald and Auschwitz. The mass gassing of almost 600 inmates from the Auschwitz concentration camp at the end of July 1941 marked the transition to a new dimension in war crime. In the first half of 1942 extermination camps for Polish and European Jews were established, especially in East Poland, under Operation Reinhard, that were able to draw on the experience gained under Action T4. About a third of the employees at the Sonnenstein Death Institute were deployed during 1942 and 1943 to the extermination camps of Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka.",

        "Retrieved from \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rena_Margulies_Chernoff\"Nils Christoffer Bockman  was a Norwegian lieutenant-colonel and businessperson. Born in Trondheim, Bockman was educated at the military academy, graduating as lieutenant in 1901. He was promoted to captain in 1905, major in 1930, and lieutenant-colonel as part of his participation in World War II in Northern Norway. Bockman started working for Meraker Brug, where he was responsible for the estates in Verdal. He was also president of Trondhjems Skiklub. In 1916, he was elected into the board of the tramway company Graakalbanen. In 1919, he was hired as director of the company, and would remain in the position until 1966, when the company was nationalized. During World War II, two members of the company's board were executed. When Bockman would not call in the Nazi-appointed board that replaced them, he was arrested and spent the rest of the war in the prison camps Falstad and Grini. Being arrested on 2 March 1943, he was imprisoned at Grini from 19 March 1944 to 8 May 1945.",

Adolf Eichmann, then head of the Central Office for Jewish Emigration for the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, was the first to realize the Nisko Plan by deporting Jews to the Lublin Reservation. While initially the Jews of East Upper Silesia were to be deported there, Eichmann expanded the program to include Jews from Mahrisch-Ostrau in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and from Vienna. Eichmann also set up a transit camp in Nisko, a town on the western border of the Lublin district, from which the deportees were to be expelled eastward.",

It was first held in January 2001 and has been on the same date every year since. The chosen date is the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz concentration camp by the Soviet Union in 1945, the date also chosen for the International Holocaust Remembrance Day and some other national Holocaust Memorial Days. In addition to the national event, there are numerous smaller memorial events around the country organised by many different organisations, groups and individuals. Since 2005, Holocaust Memorial Day has been supported by the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, a charity set up and funded by the UK Government. The theme for Holocaust Memorial Day 2019 was \"Torn From Home\"",

        "Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma's prisoner registry card at Dachau Nazi Concentration Camp  liberation of Dachau, 1945  In 1941\u20131943 Prince Xavier lived in political isolation, devoting time to his family and managing the Bourbon-Parma fortune. In 1941 he inherited from his late aunt the Puchheim castle in Austria. Prince Xavier became increasingly sympathetic to the anti-Petain opposition and, via local priests, maintained informal contact with district Resistance leaders. At one point he joined works of the Comite d'Aide aux Refractaires du STO and welcomed labor camp escapees in wooden areas of his estates, providing basic logistics and setting up shelters for the sick in his library. When two of them were detected and detained, Prince Xavier cycled to Vichy and successfully sought their release. Exposing himself, following a surveillance period in July he was arrested by the Gestapo. Sentenced to death for espionage and terrorism, he was pardoned by Petain; first confined in Clermont-Ferrand, Schirmeck and Natzwiller, in September he was finally imprisoned in Dachau. The Nazis asked Franco about his fate; the Caudillo declared total disinterest. Periodically condemned to the starvation bunker, when freed by the Americans in April 1945, Prince Xavier weighed 36\u00a0kg.",

Her parents and the other tenants of her home were forced to stand for a roll call in which Pesendorfer, the Nazi authority in their house, told the tenants that many Russian convicts had escaped from the nearby concentration camp.

The Luftwaffe killed 6,000 to 7,000 Polish civilians during the bombing of Warsaw. The German invasion saw atrocities committed against Polish men, women and children. The German forces  murdered tens of thousands of Polish civilians  and committing atrocities in numerous Polish towns, including massacres in Blonie, Zloczew, Boleslawiec, Torzeniec, Goworowo, Mlawa and Wloclawek). During Operation Tannenberg, a campaign of ethnic cleansing organized by multiple elements of the German government, tens of thousands of Polish civilians were shot at 760 mass execution sites by the Einsatzgruppen.

He was in the U.S. from 1942 to 1945, having been interned as a Jew at the Drancy internment camp  and then escaped. He began his career as a follower of Henri Bergson and the American pluralist philosophers William James and George Santayana. He is known as one of those introducing Hegelian thought in France in the 1930s , ahead of Alexandre Kojeve's more celebrated lectures. He was also a champion in French thought of the Danish proto-existentialist Soren Kierkegaard. These enthusiasms, which became the significant books Le malheur de la conscience dans la philosophie de Hegel  and Etudes kierkegaardiennes  were controversial, in the prevailing climate of thought. However, he influenced a number of key thinkers including Gilles Deleuze, Emmanuel Levinas and Jean-Paul Sartre. In the second issue of Acephale, Georges Bataille's review, Jean Wahl wrote an article titled \"Nietzsche and the Death of God\", concerning Karl Jaspers' interpretation of this work.

In 820 AD Pocking was first mentioned in a historic document. Since 1824 Pocking forms its own political community and in 1971 it was granted the privileges of a town. During the Nazi regime a side camp of the Flossenburg concentration camp was set up in Pocking. After World War II the second largest DP camp  in Germany was located in Pocking. In 1946 the camp housed 7,645 people, mostly of Jewish heritage. It was disbanded in 1949. The Rottal area to which Pocking belongs is famous for its horse breeding. That is also why the coat of arms of Pocking includes the head of a horse.

However, of the 1,037 SS members who worked at Majdanek and are known by name, only 170 were prosecuted. This was due to a rule applied by the West German justice system that only those directly involved in the murder process could be charged.",

Many were executed or died as the result of brutal medical experimentation. Over the course of its operation, over 100 Dutch resistance fighters were executed at Sachsenhausen. Dutch Freemasons were also sent to the camp including the Grand Master of the Grand Orient of the Netherlands, Hermannus Van Torgeren, who died there in March 1940, after being arrested by Klaus Barbie. The Dutch subsequently sought the extradition from Czechoslovakia of Antonin Zapotocky, who became President of Czechoslovakia, for his alleged role in the murder of Dutch prisoners during his time as a kapo at the camp. According to an article published on 13 December 2001 in The New York Times, \"In the early years of the war the SS practiced methods of mass killing there that were later used in the Nazi death camps. Of the roughly 30,000 wartime victims at Sachsenhausen, most were Russian prisoners of war\".",

Although the name began as prisoner slang, it was apparently adopted by some of the camp administration. Prisoners who worked there were known as the Aufraumungskommando  or Kanada kommando.

The government takeover of church property, \"Klostersturm\", resulted in the loss of valuable properties such as that of Stimmen der Zeit, and limited the work of the Jesuits in Germany. The Jesuit provincial, Augustin Rosch, Delp's superior in Munich, became active in the underground resistance to Hitler. Rosch introduced Delp to the Kreisau Circle. As of 1942, Delp met regularly with the clandestine group around Helmuth James Graf von Moltke to develop a model for a new social order after the Third Reich came to an end. Delp's role was to explain Catholic social teaching to the group, and to arrange contacts between Moltke and Catholic leaders, including Archbishop Konrad von Preysing of Berlin and Bishop Johannes Dietz of Fulda.",

The following year, Heydrich's SD was given responsibility for carrying out the Nacht und Nebel  decree. According to the decree, \"persons endangering German security\" were to be arrested in a maximally discreet way: \"under the cover of night and fog\". People disappeared without a trace with none told of their whereabouts or fate. For each prisoner, the SD had to fill in a questionnaire that listed personal information, country of origin, and the details of their crimes against the Reich. This questionnaire was placed in an envelope inscribed with a seal reading \"Nacht und Nebel\" and submitted to the Reich Main Security Office . In the WVHA \"Central Inmate File\", as in many camp files, these prisoners would be given a special \"covert prisoner\" code, as opposed to the code for POW, Felon, Jew, Gypsy, etc. The decree remained in effect after Heydrich's death. The exact number of people who vanished under it has never been positively established, but it is estimated to be 7,000.",

When her mother fell ill, R\u016f\u017ei\u010dkova was forced to sneak out of the camp to gather turnips in order to survive. In April 1945 R\u016f\u017ei\u010dkova and the other prisoners who could still walk were ordered to march from the camp to a railway station two miles away. They returned to the camp and woke the next morning to discover the Germans had gone. The guards had abandoned the camp, leaving no food, and had disconnected the water supply. A few German and Hungarian troops remained outside the camp, randomly shooting into the barracks on occasion. On 15 April 1945 British and Canadian soldiers arrived at Bergen-Belsen.",

By 1948, Sachsenhausen, now renamed \"Special Camp No. 1\", was the largest of three special camps in the Soviet Occupation Zone. The 60,000 people interned over five years included 6,000 German officers transferred from Western Allied camps. Others were Nazi functionaries, anti-Communists and Russians, including Nazi collaborators. By the time the camp was closed in the spring of 1950, at least 12,000 had died of malnutrition and disease. With the fall of the communist East Germany it was possible to conduct excavations in the former camps. At Sachsenhausen, the bodies of 12,500 victims were found; most were children, adolescents and elderly people.",

About 1,900 of these were sent out of the country during the next two years, and the rest remained in hiding. The total number of the Austrian Jewish population murdered during the Holocaust is about 65,500 people, 62,000 of them known by name. The rest of the Jewish population of Austria, excluding up to 5,000 who managed to survive in Austria, emigrated \u2014 about 135,000 people of Jewish religion or Jewish ancestry, compared to the number in 1938. But thousands of Austrian Jews emigrated before 1938.",

He died on 22 April 1945 at the Ganacker Camp, annex of the concentration camp of Flossenburg in Germany. As a mathematician he worked on differential geometry and topology. He was the first student of Charles Ehresmann. He is known as one of the founders of the theory of fiber bundles. He is the one who first proved that a fiber bundle over a simplex is trivializable and who used this to classify bundles over spheres. In a paper, written together with Ehresmann, he introduced the notion of an associated bundle and proved results known today as the exact homotopy sequence of a fibration.",

In 1942 Weiss was also the commanding officer of the Arbeitsdorf concentration camp with Hocker serving as his adjutant. Before being transferred in May 1943 to the Majdanek concentration camp, again as adjutant to Weiss, Hocker followed a course at the SS military academy  in Braunschweig. During the same period he also received some military training. In 1943, he became the adjutant to the commandant at Majdanek during the Operation Reinhardt mass deportations and murders. Afterward, he became adjutant to Richard Baer, in 1944, who was previously deputy to WVHA chief Oswald Pohl in Berlin. In May 1944 Hocker was transferred to Auschwitz, where he remained until the advance of the Soviet Red Army forced camp evacuation in January 1945. Thereafter, he was transferred to the Dora-Mittelbau concentration camp along with Baer. The two men administered the camp until the Allies arrived. Hocker used false papers to flee the camp and avoid being identified by the British when they captured him.",

Administratively it was part of the head of the Hohenelbe district, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia. In 1918 it became part Czechoslovakia, when the Czechs regained independence. From 1938 to 1945 it was occupied by Germany, and was then administered as one of the municipalities in Sudetenland. During the occupation, the Germans established and operated a Gestapo prison in the town, and a subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp for female prisoners in the Ho\u0159ej\u0161i Vrchlabi district. Nazi Germany also brought many Italian, French, English and Russian prisoners of war to work as forced laborers in the town. The town's Germans who had not fled in World War II were expelled according to the Potsdam Agreement and Bene\u0161 decrees. The town was restored to Czechoslovakia.

        "Killing process Unlike Nazi concentration camps in which prisoners were used as forced labour, extermination camps such as Treblinka had only one function: to kill those sent there. To prevent incoming victims from realising its nature, Treblinka II was disguised as a transit camp for deportations further east, complete with made-up train schedules, a fake train-station clock with hands painted on it, names of destinations, a fake ticket window, and the sign \"Ober Majdan\", a code word for Treblinka commonly used to deceive prisoners arriving from Western Europe. Majdan was a prewar landed estate 5 kilometres  away from the camp.",

        "World War II During World War II, Borsum was active in warning and helping Jews that risked deportation to German camps, and came to be member of a network which helped people escape to Sweden.  She was arrested in April 1943, and incarcerated at the Grini concentration camp for two months.  28 June 1943 she was sent to Germany, with MS Monte Rosa from Oslo to Arhus, and further with railway transport to Hamburg. After a short stay at the Hutten Gefangnis in Hamburg she ended up as Nacht und Nebel prisoner at the Ravensbruck concentration camp, a camp specifically for women. She was held at Ravensbruck until 8 April 1945, when the surviving Scandinavian prisoners were transported home with the White Buses organized by the Swedish Red Cross.",

Around 1903 she met  Wilhelm Paetzel who was frequently in Landsberg where his family lived. Paetzel had an important job with \"Vorwarts\", a Berlin publishing house, and was also an activist with the SPD and the Landsberg party candidate in the 1907 election. Marie Juchacz joined the SPD herself in 1908. In a campaign headed up by August Bebel the SPD had called for women to be permitted to join political parties in 1879, but they were nevertheless excluded until the repeal of the old Prussian Association Law in 1908. Marie Juchacz was one of the first female party members. It would be more than another decade before women were allowed to vote in German elections however.",

After capturing the Kalmyk territory, German army officials established a propaganda campaign with the assistance of anti-communist Kalmyk nationalists, including white emigre, Kalmyk exiles. German benevolence, however, did not extend to all people living in the Kalmyk ASSR.  At least 93 Jewish families, for example, were rounded up and killed. The total Jewish dead numbered between 100 and upwards of 700, according to documents held in the Kalmyk State Archives. The campaign was focused primarily on recruiting and organizing Kalmyk men into anti-Soviet militia units.",

        "Construction and WAC use Camp Ruston was built by the local T.L. James Company under the supervision of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on 770 acres  about seven miles  west of Ruston, Louisiana in 1942. The land was purchased for $24,200, and construction cost $2.5 million. Camp Ruston was originally designated as an \"Enemy Alien Internment Camp\", a detention facility for internees of Japanese ancestry. Plans for the internment of enemy aliens that may have also included internees of German and Italian ancestries never developed and the need for additional enemy alien internment camps were abandoned. It soon became evident that Camp Ruston's usage plan would change due to the unexpected number of POWs being housed in Europe needing to be transferred. The camp served first as a training center for the Fifth Women's Army Corps from March to June 1943. Approximately 2,000 WACs received basic training at the camp. Once plans for prisoners were made to bring prisoners to Camp Ruston, the WAC training center was moved in order to make room for the expected large numbers of POW's captured in the European and Northern African Theaters.",

In 1941, Zoddel was sentenced to a year in prison for theft before being transferred to Sachsenhausen concentration camp in 1942. He worked as a forced laborer in the Heinkel factory in Oranienburg until October 1943. In November 1943, after a brief stay at Buchenwald concentration camp, he was taken to Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. On 27 March 1944, Zoddel and 1,000 other prisoners from Mittelbau-Dora arrived at Bergen-Belsen. By January 1945, Zoddel had risen in the ranks to a camp division. Two days after the liberation of Bergen-Belsen by the British army on 15 April 1945, Zoddel killed a female detainee, a crime for which he was sentenced to death by a British military court in Celle on 31 August 1945. On 17 November 1945, Zoddel was sentenced to life imprisonment in a second trial for his actions at Bergen-Belsen. His execution was carried out later that month in Wolfenbuttel by guillotine.",

For Nazi German labor camp at this location, see Potulice concentration camp. After the end of World War II, the Central Labour Camp in Potulice  became a detention centre for Germans and anti-communist Poles. It was set up by the Soviet and Polish Communist authorities in Potulice in place of the former Nazi German Potulice concentration camp , the subcamp of Stutthof built in 1941. Following liberation by the Red Army, the camp was controlled by the Soviet NKVD Department of Prisoners and Internees until June 1945. Repopulated, it remained in operation until 1949 under the management of the Stalinist Ministry of Public Security of Poland.",

        "Lifting of the Iron Curtain, 1990s\u2013present With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union during the early 1990s, neo-Nazism began to spread its ideas in the East, as hostility to the triumphant liberal order was high and revanchism a widespread feeling. In Russia, during the chaos of the early 1990s, an amorphous mixture of KGB hardliners, Orthodox neo-Tsarist nostalgics  and explicit Neo-Nazis found themselves strewn together in the same camp. They were united by opposition to the influence of the United States, against the liberalising legacy of Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika and on the Jewish question, Soviet Zionology merged with a more explicit anti-Jewish sentiment. The most significant organisation representing this was Russian National Unity under the leadership of Alexander Barkashov, where black-uniform clad Russians marched with a red flag incorporating the Swastika under the banner of Russia for Russians. These forces came together in a last gasp effort to save the Supreme Soviet of Russia against Boris Yeltsin during the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis. As well as events in Russia, in newly independent ex-Soviet states, annual commemorations for SS volunteers now took place; particularly in Latvia, Estonia and the Ukraine.",

The film began in 2012 when Baseman first traveled to Eastern Europe on a Fulbright Fellowship, detouring to his parents' hometowns which had not been visited by any family member in over 60 years. Mythical Creatures aims to connect the stories of the Holocaust to an entirely new generation through Baseman's parents' dark experiences during World War II. The film combines live action documentary elements, along with extensive animated sequences, and other storytelling techniques. Baseman says, \"It's really about taking all of the different narratives from the myths I've been told and mixing them with my characters to try and find my truth,\" he says. \"We're not doing it in a straightforward historical way. It's really an exploration of my psyche.\" Mythical Creatures has the support of the Sundance Institute's New Frontier Story Lab and the Museum of the Holocaust in Los Angeles.",

His investigation, begun in 1956, was renewed in 1991 by the Institute of National Remembrance. He was tried in a 2001 court case in Poznan. The collapse of several communist regimes and release of new records made it possible.

Holocaust deniers claim that the extermination camps were actually transit camps from which Jews were deported farther east. However, these theories are disproven by surviving German documents, which show that Jews were sent to the camps to be killed. Extermination camp research is difficult because of extensive attempts by the SS and Nazi regime to conceal the existence of the extermination camps. The existence of the extermination camps is firmly established by testimonies of camp survivors and Final Solution perpetrators, material evidence , Nazi photographs and films of the killings, and camp administration records.",

        "Non-Jewish Poles Main article: Nazi crimes against the Polish nation Hitler made clear that Polish workers were to be kept in what Robert Gellately called a \"permanent condition of inferiority\". In a memorandum to Hitler dated 25 May 1940, \"A Few Thoughts on the Treatment of the Ethnically Alien Population in the East\", Himmler stated that it was in German interests to foster divisions between the ethnic groups in the East. He wanted to restrict non-Germans in the conquered territories to an elementary-school education that would teach them how to write their names, count up to 500, work hard, and obey Germans. The Polish political class became the target of a campaign of murder . Between 1.8 and 1.9\u00a0million non-Jewish Polish citizens were killed by Germans during the war; about four-fifths were ethnic Poles and the rest Ukrainians and Belarusians. At least 200,000 died in concentration camps, around 146,000 in Auschwitz. Others died in massacres or in uprisings such as the Warsaw Uprising, where 120,000\u2013200,000 were killed.",

On 20 May 1940 he came from the Sachsenhausen concentration camp to Auschwitz I in a group of 30 criminal prisoners. His prison number was number 2. As a prisoner functionary, he was responsible to coordinate the work of the prisoners and used his position to help them, for instance by assigning good labour details to weaker prisoners. On the afternoon of December 1942, Kusel escaped together with the Polish prisoners, Jan Baras Komski, Mieczyslaw Januszewski and Boleslaw Kuczbara. Kusel was arrested in Warsaw and sent back to Auschwitz in September 1943. He was kept in isolation until November and released to the main camp in November during an amnesty related to the taking of office of the new commander Arthur Liebehenschel. On 9 November 1944 he was sent to Flossenburg.",

        "Bombing of Dresden Kurowski wrote several books that discuss the February 1945 Allied air raids on Dresden. His book Das Massaker von Dresden und der anglo-amerikanische Bombenterror 1944/45  was published by the extreme right-wing publisher Druffel Verlag in 1996. His other books on the subject, Bomben uber Dresden  and Dresden, followed in 2001 and 2003. In the context of the World War II bombing campaigns, Kurowski's interpretation of the air war and the Dresden raid hued closely to the account offered by Hans Rumpf, the German fire protection inspector during World War II and postwar author. Both Rumpf and Kurowski used the term \"terror-bombing\" exclusively to describe Allied air attacks, and presented the Luftwaffe raids against purely civilian targets as \"retaliation attacks\". In his writings, Kurowski emphasised that the Allied propaganda \"hugely exaggerated\" the effects of these raids.",

In the early 1990s, at the age of 74, Pietzner was awarded the title \"Stalinist victim\" and given 64,350 ] . Many historians argued that she had lied and did not deserve the money. She had, in fact, served time in a German prison which was overseen by the Soviets, but she was imprisoned because she had served brutally in the ranks of three concentration camps.

        "Results  Prokhorovka Cathedral, in Prokhorovka on the former battlefield, commemorates the Red Army losses and victory. The campaign was a strategic Soviet success. For the first time, a major German offensive had been stopped before achieving a breakthrough; the maximum depth of the German advance was 8\u201312 kilometres  in the north and 35 kilometres  in the south. The Germans, despite using more technologically advanced armour than in previous years, were unable to break through the in-depth Soviet defences and were caught off guard by the significant operational reserves of the Red Army. This result changed the pattern of operations on the Eastern Front, with the Soviet Union gaining the operational initiative. The Soviet victory was costly, with the Red Army losing considerably more men and materiel than the German Army. However, the Soviet Union's larger industrial potential and pool of manpower allowed them to absorb and replenish these losses. Guderian wrote:",

Unable to stretch out completely, they slept there both lengthwise and crosswise, with one man's feet on another's head, neck, or chest. Stripped of all human dignity, they pushed and shoved and bit and kicked each other in an effort to get a few more inches' space on which to sleep a little more comfortably. For they did not have long to sleep. Sunday was not a work day, but prisoners had to clean the barracks and take their weekly shower, and were allowed to write  to their families, although the SS censored the mail. Inmates who did not speak German would trade bread for help. Observant Jews tried to keep track of the Hebrew calendar and Jewish holidays, including Shabbat, and the weekly Torah portion. No watches, calendars, or clocks were permitted in the camp. Only two Jewish calendars made in Auschwitz survived to the end of the war. Prisoners kept track of the days in other ways, such as obtaining information from newcomers.",

Defendants ranged from members of the SS to kapos, privileged prisoners responsible for low-level control of camp internees, and included some of those responsible for the process of \"selection,\" or determination of who should be sent to the gas chambers directly from the \"ramp\" upon disembarking the trains that brought them from across Europe . In the course of the trial, approximately 360 witnesses were called, including around 210 survivors. Proceedings began in the \"Burgerhaus Gallus\", in Frankfurt am Main, which was converted into a courthouse for that purpose, and remained there until their conclusion.",

Although initially the camps of Gusen and Mauthausen mostly served the local quarries, from 1942 onwards they began to be included in the German war machine. To accommodate the ever-growing number of slave workers, additional subcamps  of Mauthausen were built.  By the end of the war, the list included 101 camps  which covered most of modern Austria, from Mittersill south of Salzburg to Schwechat east of Vienna and from Passau on the prewar Austro-German border to the Loibl Pass on the border with Yugoslavia. The subcamps were divided into several categories, depending on their main function: Produktionslager for factory workers, Baulager for construction, Aufraumlager for cleaning the rubble in Allied-bombed towns, and Kleinlager  where the inmates were working specifically for the SS.",

        "History The first mentioned intoxication goes back to ancient India and also Hippocrates mentions a neurological disorder 46 B.C. in Greece caused by Lathyrus seed. Lathyrism was occurring on a regular basis. During the Spanish War of Independence against Napoleon, grasspea served as a famine food. This was the subject of one of Francisco de Goya's famous aquatint prints titled Gracias a la Almorta , depicting poor people surviving on a porridge made from grasspea flour, one of them lying on the floor, already crippled by it. During WWII, on the order of Colonel I. Murgescu, commandant of the Vapniarka concentration camp in Transnistria, the detainees - most of them Jews - were fed nearly exclusively with fodder pea. Consequently, they became ill from lathyrism. In the film Ashes  by Andrzej Wajda based on the novel Popioly  translated as Lost army  by Stefan Zeromski spanning the period 1798\u20131812, a horse is poisoned by grain from a Spanish village. The footage of the horse losing control of its hind legs suggests that it was fed with Almortas.",

        "Liberation As most of the camps of the Mittelbau system were completely evacuated, there were not many prisoners left to be liberated by the Allies. Only some small subcamps, mostly containing Italian POWs, were not evacuated. The SS also left several hundred sick prisoners at Dora and in the Boelcke-Kaserne. They were freed when US troops  reached Nordhausen on 11 April 1945. There were also around 1,300 dead prisoners at the barracks. War correspondents took pictures and made films of the dead and dying prisoners at Dora. Like the documentation of Nazi atrocities at Bergen-Belsen, these were published around the globe and became some of the best-known testimonies of Nazi crimes. Most of those inmates who survived the transports were freed in mid-April at Bergen-Belsen or at other camps. Some, however, remained prisoners until early May and were freed in Mecklenburg or Austria. In total, even conservative estimates put the number of people who did not survive being sent to Mittelbau-Dora at over 20,000. Thus, around one in three of those confined here did not survive.",

Rumors about an alleged German \"extermination\" plan infuriated the French and strengthened their support of the new regime. Within a few weeks, five new armies totalling more than 500,000 troops were recruited. The Germans dispatched some of their troops to the French provinces to detect, attack and disperse the new French armies before they could become a menace. The Germans were not prepared for an occupation of the whole of France.",

He had been active in promoting the veneration of the Immaculate Virgin Mary, founding and supervising the monastery of Niepokalanow near Warsaw, operating an amateur-radio station , and founding or running several other organizations and publications. On 10 October 1982 Pope John Paul II canonized Father Kolbe and declared him a  martyr of charity. The  Catholic Church venerates him as the patron saint of amateur-radio operators, of drug addicts, of political prisoners, of families, of journalists, of prisoners, and of the pro-life movement. John Paul II declared him \"The Patron Saint of Our Difficult Century\". His feast day is 14 August, the day of his death. Due to Kolbe's efforts to promote consecration and entrustment to Mary, he is known as the Apostle of Consecration to Mary.",

He was born in Rumelange. In 1936, he defeated Karl Lutz of Austria in the round of 32 before being eliminated in the quarterfinals of the heavyweight class by eventual bronze medalist Erling Nilsen of Norway. He was shot in the Hinzert concentration camp  after being arrested as one of the leaders in the general strike against the Nazi occupation in Luxembourg on 31 August 1942. The country had been protesting against the introduction of compulsory military service for young Luxembourgers in the German army. Toussaint's widow and his two sons were deported.",

Many students also thought \"the tragic death of Bruno brought about the end of concentration camps.\" Criticising the book's accuracy, the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum commented in 2020 that the novel \"should be avoided by anyone who studies or teaches about the Holocaust.\"",

        "Remembrance Days of remembrance Memorials and museums Righteous Among the Nations vte Anti-Jewish laws were enacted by the Vichy France government in 1940 and 1941 affecting metropolitan France and its overseas territories during World War II. These laws were, in fact, decrees of head of state Marshal Philippe Petain, since Parliament was no longer in office as of 11 July 1940. The motivation for the legislation was spontaneous and was not mandated by Germany. These laws were declared null and void on 9 August 1944 after liberation and on the restoration of republican legality. The statutes were aimed at depriving Jews of the right to hold public office, designating them as a lower class, and depriving them of citizenship. Many Jews were subsequently rounded up at Drancy internment camp before being deported for extermination in Nazi concentration camps.",

According to historians Donald Niewyk and Francis Nicosia, the genocide of the Romani began later than that of the Jews and a smaller percentage was killed. Hitler's genocidal campaign against Europe's Romani population involved the application of Nazi \"racial hygiene\" . Despite discriminatory measures, some Romani  were spared deportation and death, with the remaining Romani groups suffering a fate similar to that of the Jews. Romani were deported to the Jewish ghettos, were shot by SS Einsatzgruppen in their villages, or deported and gassed in Auschwitz-Birkenau and Treblinka.",

During this period, Rossel participated in seventeen missions, each time visiting several prisoner of war camps. Four of these missions were to camps in the Sudetenland, which, along with his good relationship with Dr. Roland Marti, the head of the Berlin Red Cross delegation, may have influenced his selection for the Theresienstadt visit, despite his inexperience. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, his visits to camps in Upper Silesia put him into contact with prisoners who were aware of the gassing of prisoners at Auschwitz concentration camp, but Rossel later said that he had no knowledge of that.",

He left the Advocate to spend time in Europe; returning to take a job with the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. At 24, he went to college, enrolling as a special student at Harvard University. When he finished, he returned to the Eagle, traveling during summers to distant locales.

        "Night-and-Fog decree  Heydrich in 1940 By late 1940, German armies had invaded most of Western Europe. The following year, Heydrich's SD was given responsibility for carrying out the Nacht und Nebel  decree. According to the decree, \"persons endangering German security\" were to be arrested in a maximally discreet way: \"under the cover of night and fog\". People disappeared without a trace with none told of their whereabouts or fate. For each prisoner, the SD had to fill in a questionnaire that listed personal information, country of origin, and the details of their crimes against the Reich. This questionnaire was placed in an envelope inscribed with a seal reading \"Nacht und Nebel\" and submitted to the Reich Main Security Office . In the WVHA \"Central Inmate File\", as in many camp files, these prisoners would be given a special \"covert prisoner\" code, as opposed to the code for POW, Felon, Jew, Gypsy, etc. The decree remained in effect after Heydrich's death. The exact number of people who vanished under it has never been positively established, but it is estimated to be 7,000.",

Initially intended not for mass murder but for prisoners who had been executed or had otherwise died in the camp, the crematorium was in operation from August 1940 until July 1943, by which time the crematoria at Auschwitz II had taken over. By May 1942 three ovens had been installed in crematorium I, which together could burn 340 bodies in 24 hours. The first experimental gassing took place around August 1941, when Lagerfuhrer Karl Fritzsch, at the instruction of Rudolf Hoss, killed a group of Soviet prisoners of war by throwing Zyklon B crystals into their basement cell in block 11 of Auschwitz I. A second group of 600 Soviet prisoners of war and around 250 sick Polish prisoners were gassed on 3\u20135 September. The morgue was later converted to a gas chamber able to hold at least 700\u2013800 people. Zyklon B was dropped into the room through slits in the ceiling.",

        "1935 schism In 1935, a majority of the Old Catholic Mariavite Church clergy, many of whom had participated in his \"innovations\", deemed him to have become a \"dictator\" and deposed Kowalski. He rejected the \"coup\" and moved out of the Plock sanctuary and installed his headquarters in the village of Felicjanow, named for the foundress. He declared his loyal following to be the Catholic Mariavite Church, despite its considerable departure from traditional doctrinal Catholic teaching. Kowalski, by then promoted to archbishop, continued to consider himself the valid leader of all genuine Mariavites. Freed from the restraining influences of much of the clergy, formerly subordinate to him, he made ever more radical pronouncements, including the view that Kozlowska had in fact been the \"incarnation of the Holy Spirit on earth\". In 1940 Kowalski was arrested by the Gestapo and taken to Dachau concentration camp. He died in a Nazi extermination facility in 1942. His leadership in the church passed to his widow, Maria Izabela Wilucka-Kowalska, who was already a consecrated bishop. She held the position until her own death in 1946.",

The Warsaw Ghetto was sealed on November 16, 1940. As the pace of deportations increased, and it became clear that the destination was the Treblinka death camp and few Jewish Varsovians were likely to survive, Ringelblum had the archives stored in three milk cans and ten metal boxes, which were then buried in three places in the Ghetto.

The occupants of one barracks rioted as 271 of the Russian deserters were to be loaded onto trains that would return them to Russian-controlled lands, as agreed at the Yalta Conference. Ten of the soldiers, who had been captured in German Army uniforms, committed suicide during the riot. Twenty-one others attempted suicide, apparently with razor blades. Many had \"cracked heads\" inflicted by 500 American guards, in the attempt to bring the situation under control. Inmates barricaded themselves inside and set fire to the building, tore off their clothing, and linked arms to resist being removed from the building. Some begged American soldiers to shoot them. Tear gas was used by the soldiers before rushing the building. The Kaserne quarters and other buildings used by the guards and trainee guards were converted and served as the Eastman Barracks, an American military post. After the closure of the Eastman Barracks in 1974, these areas are now occupied by the Bavarian Bereitschaftspolizei .",

In September 1992, barracks 38 and 39 of the Jewish Museum were severely damaged in an arson attack. The perpetrators were arrested, and the barracks were reconstructed by 1997. However, it is important to note that the decision was taken that no buildings built during the Nazi regime will be rebuilt on the site. The destroyed section of the huts are now a Jewish museum with the surviving section left as it was immediately after the fire with the paint still blistered from the flames.

        "Efforts to preserve the historical record During the war One of the earliest efforts to save historical record of the Holocaust occurred during the war, in France, where Drancy internment camp records were carefully preserved and turned over to the new National Office for Veterans and Victims of War; however, the bureau then held them in secret, refusing to release copies later, even to the Center of Contemporary Jewish Documentation . In 1943, Isaac Schneersohn, anticipating the need for a center to document and preserve the memory of the persecution for historical reasons and also support claims post-war, gathered together 40 representatives from Jewish organizations in Grenoble which was under Italian occupation at the time in order to form a centre de documentation.  Exposure meant the death penalty, and as a result little actually happened before liberation. Serious work began after the center moved to Paris in late 1944 and was renamed the CDJC.",

A military official at the camp estimated 1,032 out of 1,795 prisoners held at the camp in September 1906 having died, it is estimated that eventually only 245 of these prisoners survived. In December 1906, an average of 8.5 prisoners died per day. By March 1907, according to records that do exist, 1,203 Nama prisoners had died on the island. The over-all figure for deaths at the camp has been estimated as being as many as 3,000. Combined with deaths amongst prisoners held elsewhere in Luderitz bay, the total may well exceed 4,000. The vast majority of these prisoners died through preventable diseases such as typhoid and scurvy exacerbated by malnutrition, over-work and the unsanitary conditions in the camps.",

        "Disposition of the property of the victims See also: August Frank memorandum Approximately 178 million German Reichsmarks' worth of Jewish property  was taken from the victims, with vast transfers of gold and valuables to the Reichsbank's \"Melmer\" account, Gold Pool, and monetary reserve. But this wealth did not only go to the German authorities, because corruption was rife within the death camps. Many of the individual SS members and policemen involved in the killings took cash, property, and valuables for themselves. The higher-ranking SS men stole on an enormous scale. It was a common practice among the top echelon. Two Majdanek commandants, Karl-Otto Koch and Hermann Florstedt, were tried by the SS for it in April 1945. SS-Sturmbannfuhrer Georg Konrad Morgen, an SS judge from the SS Courts Office, prosecuted so many Nazi officers for individual violations that Himmler personally ordered him to restrain his cases by April 1944.",

Jean AmeryThis is an image of Jean AmeryBornHanns Chaim Mayer31 October 1912Vienna, Austria-HungaryDied17 October 1978 Salzburg, AustriaOccupationAuthor Jean Amery , born Hanns Chaim Mayer, was an Austria-born essayist whose work was often informed by his experiences during World War II. His most celebrated work, At the Mind's Limits: Contemplations by a Survivor on Auschwitz and Its Realities , suggests that torture was \"the essence\" of the Third Reich. Other notable works included On Aging  and On Suicide: A Discourse on Voluntary Death . He first adopted the pseudonym Jean Amery in 1955. Amery took his own life in 1978. Formerly a philosophy and literature student in Vienna, Amery's participation in organized resistance against the Nazi occupation of Belgium resulted in his detainment and torture by the German Gestapo at Fort Breendonk, and several years of imprisonment in concentration camps. Amery survived internments in Auschwitz and Buchenwald, and was finally liberated at Bergen-Belsen in 1945. After the war he settled in Belgium.",

        "Umschlagplatz of the Warsaw GhettoNational monument at the Ghetto's former Umschlagplatz symbolizing an open freight car, Stawki Street, WarsawPolish Jews loaded onto trains at the Warsaw Ghetto Umschlagplatz  was the term used during The Holocaust to denote the holding areas adjacent to railway stations in occupied Poland where Jews from ghettos were assembled for deportation to Nazi death camps. The largest collection point was in Warsaw next to the Warsaw Ghetto. In 1942 between 254,000 \u2013 265,000 Jews passed through the Warsaw Umschlagplatz on their way to the Treblinka extermination camp during Operation Reinhard, the deadliest phase of the Holocaust in Poland. Often those awaiting the arrival of Holocaust trains, were held at the Umschlagplatz overnight. Other examples of Umschlagplatz include the one at Radogoszcz station - adjacent to the Lodz Ghetto - where people were sent to Chelmno extermination camp and Auschwitz. In 1988, a memorial was erected in Warsaw to commemorate the deportation victims from the Umschlagplatz. The monument resembles a freight car with its doors open. It is located on the corner of Stawki Street.",

        "Death and legacy On 30 April 1940 his staff quarters, in a ravine near the village of Anielin , were ambushed. In an unequal battle Dobrzanski and most of his men were killed. The Germans desecrated his body and put it on public view in the local villages. They then transported it to Tomaszow Mazowiecki and either burnt it or buried it in an unknown location. The remnants of the \"Separated Unit of the Polish Army\" continued the struggle until 25 June 1940, when it was disbanded. In 1949 Dobrzanski's son, Ludwik, emigrated to England and became a property developer. He died on 15 December 1990 in Bedford. In 1966 Henryk Dobrzanski was posthumously awarded the Golden Cross of the Virtuti Militari and promoted to Colonel. Currently almost 200 organisations and institutions bear his name, including 82 Scouting groups, 31 schools and several military units. There are streets named after him in almost every Polish city. The site of his burial remains unknown. In 1973 the film Hubal, based on his resistance campaign, was released. The pseudonym \"Hubal\" comes from his family coat of arms.",

Because of Stalinist emphasis on its urban population, interwar migration inadvertently rescued countless Soviet Jews; Nazi Germany penetrated the entire former Jewish Pale\u2014but were kilometers short of Leningrad and Moscow. The migration of many Jews farther East from the Jewish Pale, which would become occupied by Nazi Germany, saved at least 40 percent of the Pale's original Jewish population. By 1941, it was estimated that the Soviet Union was home to 4.855\u00a0million Jews, around 30% of all Jews worldwide. However, the majority of these were residents of rural western Belarus and Ukraine\u2014populations that suffered greatly due to the German occupation and the Holocaust. Only around 800,000 Jews lived outside the occupied territory, and 1,200,000 to 1,400,000 Jews were eventually evacuated eastwards. Of the three million left in occupied areas, the vast majority is thought to have perished in German extermination camps.",

        "Forgotten and rediscovered history After the war, the existence of Romani Nazi camps was practically forgotten outside the Romani community, except by specialized historians. The whole community of Czech Romani was annihilated and the new ones, who came from Slovakia and Romania, had no knowledge of this tragedy. During the 1970s, a large factory pig farm was constructed near the site of the Lety camp. A tourist hotel has been built on the site of the Hodonin camp. In the 1970s and 1980s, Czech historians, notably Prof. Ctibor Ne\u010das, researched and described the persecution of Roma during the Nazi occupation, including the camps in Lety and Hodonin. In 1992 the book Black Silence by Paul Polansky compiled historical records and testimonials of survivors. The book started heated discussions in the Czech Republic about Czech relations to the Romani and their history. The most recent book on Lety is 1997's And No One Will Believe You by Markus Pape.  One review noted:",

        "Soviet zone From the beginning, denazification in the Soviet zone was considered a critical element of the transformation into a socialist society and was quickly and effectively put into practice. Members of the Nazi Party and its organizations were arrested and interned. The NKVD was directly in charge of this process, and oversaw the camps. In 1948, the camps were placed under the same administration as the gulag in the Soviet government. According to official records, 122,600 people were interned. 34,700 of those interned in this process were considered to be Soviet citizens, with the rest being German. This process happened at the same time as the expropriation of large landowners and Junkers, who were also often former Nazi supporters. Because part of the intended goal of denazification in the Soviet zone was also the removal of anti-socialist sentiment, the committees in charge of the process were politically skewed. A typical panel would have one member from the Christian Democratic Union, one from the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany, three from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and three from political mass organizations .",

        "Naked Soviet prisoners of war in Mauthausen concentration camp. The Germans officially justified their policy on the grounds that the Soviet Union had not signed the Geneva Convention. Legally, however, under article 82 of the Geneva Convention, signatory countries had to give POWs of all signatory and non-signatory countries the rights assigned by the convention. Shortly after the German invasion in 1941, the USSR made Berlin an offer of a reciprocal adherence to the Hague Conventions. Third Reich officials left the Soviet \"note\"  unanswered. In contrast, Nikolai Tolstoy recounts that the German Government \u2013 as well as the International Red Cross \u2013 made several efforts to regulate reciprocal treatment of prisoners until early 1942, but received no answers from the Soviet side. Further, the Soviets took a harsh position towards captured Soviet soldiers, as they expected each soldier to fight to the death, and automatically excluded any prisoner from the \"Russian community\". Some Soviet POWs and forced labourers whom the Germans had transported to Nazi Germany were, on their return to the USSR, treated as traitors and sent to gulag prison-camps.",

        "18th and 19th centuries The foundation of the abbey of Fulda and its territory originated with an Imperial grant, and the sovereign principality therefore was subject only to the German emperor. Fulda became a bishopric in 1752 and the prince-abbots were given the additional title of prince-bishop. The prince-abbots  ruled Fulda and the surrounding region until the bishopric was forcibly dissolved by Napoleon I in 1802. The city went through a baroque building campaign in the 18th century, resulting in the current \"Baroque City\" status. This included a remodeling of Fulda Cathedral  and of the Stadtschloss  by Johann Dientzenhofer. The city parish church, St. Blasius, was built between 1771\u201385. In 1764 a porcelain factory was started in Fulda under Prince-Bishop, Prince-Abbot Heinrich von Bibra, but shortly after his death it was closed down in 1789 by his successor, Prince-Bishop, Prince-Abbot Adalbert von Harstall. The city was given to Prince William Frederick of Orange-Nassau  in 1803 , was annexed to the Grand Duchy of Berg in 1806, and in 1809 to the Principality of Frankfurt. After the Congress of Vienna of 1814\u201315, most of the territory went to the Electorate of Hesse, which Prussia annexed in 1866.",

        "National monument in the former camp In 1948 the camp commandant and guards of Amersfoort were tried and convicted for their crimes.  Karl Peter Berg was sentenced to death and was executed in 1949. Josef Johann Kotalla was also sentenced to death but later commuted to life in prison. Along with three other prisoners he became involved in what was known as the \"Breda Four\u00a0\", a group of prisoners whose possible release stirred up very strong feelings amongst Dutchmen.  Kotalla was never released and died in prison. The NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies has many resources concerning the guards of Amersfoort and their trials.  The NIOD has dossiers on the following Amersfoort guards and personnel:  Berg, Brahm, Dohmen, Fernau, Helle, Kotalla, May, van der Neut, Oberle, Stover, Voight, Westerveld and Wolf.

Operation Reinhard or Operation Reinhardt  was the codename of the secretive German plan in World War II to exterminate Polish Jews in the General Government district of German-occupied Poland. This deadliest phase of the Holocaust was marked by the introduction of extermination camps. As many as two million Jews were sent to Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka to be put to death in purpose-built gas chambers. In addition, mass-killing facilities, using Zyklon B, were developed at about the same time at the Majdanek concentration camp and at Auschwitz II-Birkenau, near the earlier-established Auschwitz I camp for ethnically Polish prisoners.",

        "Biography Arthur Sodtke was born in Inowrazlaw, Province of Posen . His father Gustav Sodtke  was a roofer. The family moved to Berlin in 1904, where Arthur Sodtke grew up. Sodtke lived in Berlin-Prenzlauer Berg and became a metal worker. He was a member of the works council of the  Schultheiss brewery and joined the German Communist Party in 1929. In 1933 he became active in the resistance against the Nazis. He was arrested in 1936 for distributing antifascist leaflets at his workplace in the Berlin plant of the \"Durener Metallwerke\", but was soon released after the same leaflets were found again while he was in custody. In World War II he joined the resistance group of Heinrich Preuss, Wilhelm Rietze and Robert Uhrig, for whom he contacted antifascists at Borsig, Gottfried Lindner AG and the Schultheiss brewery. Sodtke was arrested on 4 February 1942 and imprisoned at Sachsenhausen concentration camp and Potsdam prison. The Volksgerichtshof sentenced him to death on 21 June 1944 along with Wilhelm Bose, Johann Pierschke, Walter Strohmann und Hermann Tops. The sentence was carried out on 14 August 1944 at Brandenburg-Gorden Prison.",

        "History Block 66 was created in 1945, during the last year of the war. The need for this block was related to the rapidly increasing number of children in Buchenwald. In April 1943, there were only 142 inmates under the age of twenty. At this time, the children were kept hidden in Block 8, located in the main camp. By the time December 1944 rolled around however, there were over 23,000 inmates under the age of 20, which was 37% percent of the population. The age group of specifically 14-18 year olds, was around eighty-five percent of the total number of children in the camp. The youngest reported inmate was a Polish three years-old. During the last year of the war, the Nazis began sending large numbers of Jewish Eastern European children to Buchenwald as a result of their failing war efforts. The Nazis were forced to evacuate other camps due to the Allied Powers closing in on the German fronts.",

Many of them were prisoners, either Communists or public figures opposing the German occupation, from the Banjica concentration camp.  A large memorial park, with a monument to the victims, was opened on October 20, 1964, marking the 20th anniversary of the Partisan army entering Belgrade. City authorities tried to construct the proper memorial for a long time. In 1987, city announced the third design competition for the memorial. Among 42 submitted works, the commission decided for the work of Vojin Stojic\u00a0. Architect Bogdan Bogdanovic, head of the commission, noted that such work can't be done in concrete, as suggested by the author, so instead a sculpture of stainless steel was made. It was officially dedicated in 1988.",

        "Statue of Gneisenau in Berlin  Frederick William III hesitated about the military reforms, the officer corps and nobility resisted them and even the bourgeoisie remained sceptical.  The start of the German campaign of 1813 was the key factor.  On 9 February 1813 a decree replaced the previous conscription system with an obligation to serve by canton , and this new system had to last for the whole war.  Thus it looked to restore the pride and position of the common soldier in adapting army discipline to civil law.  The punishments and in particular the 'schlague'  were abolished.  The social differences had to disappear.  The Treaty of Tilsit had reduced the Prussian army to 42,000 men, but Scharnhorst put in place the \"Krumper system\", which consisted of training a number of soldiers in rotation without ever exceeding the numbers authorised by the Treaty.  Between 30,000 and 150,000 supplementary men were also trained \u2013 the training system changed several times and so it is difficult to work out precise numbers. Compulsory military service was ordered by Frederick William III on 27 May 1814 then fixed by a military law on 3 September the same year:",

From June 1944 until March 1945 the position of Oberaufseherin in Bromberg-Ost was held by Johanna Wisotzki, while among guards reassigned to Bromberg-Ost from Stutthof were the notoriously cruel aufseherinnen Ewa Paradies, Herta Bothe and Gerda Steinhoff who took part in selections of prisoners to be sent to the gas chambers. A group of thirteen ex-officials and overseers of the Bromberg-Ost and Stutthof concentration camps were tried and convicted of crimes against humanity at the Stutthof trials, the war crime tribunals held at Gdansk, Poland, from April 25, 1946, to May 31, 1946.

He was the first political prisoner released by Mikhail Gorbachev. Sharansky and three low-level Western spies  were exchanged for Czech spies Karl Koecher and Hana Koecher held in the United States, Soviet spy Yevgeni Zemlyakov, Polish spy Marian Zacharski, and East German spy Detlef Scharfenorth . The men were released in two stages, with Sharansky freed first then whisked away, accompanied by the United States Ambassador to West Germany, Richard R. Burt. The exchange took place on the Glienicke Bridge between West Berlin and East Germany, which had been used before for this purpose.",

He humiliated France in the process, but kept on good terms with Austria-Hungary. With that accomplished by 1871 he then skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to preserve Germany's new role and keep Europe at peace. The new German Empire industrialized rapidly and challenged Britain for economic leadership. Bismarck disliked colonies but public and elite opinion forced him to build an overseas empire. He was removed from office in 1890 by an aggressive young Kaiser Wilhelm II, who pursued a disruptive foreign policy that polarized Europe into rival camps. These rival camps went to war with each other in 1914.",

Competing against Douglas and Martin for a contract to build 200 bombers, the Boeing entry outperformed both the other competitors and more than met the Air Corps' expectations.  Although Boeing lost the contract due to the prototype's crash, the Air Corps was so impressed with Boeing's design that they ordered thirteen B-17s.  The B-17 Flying Fortress went on to enter full-scale production and was considered the first truly mass-produced large aircraft, eventually evolving through numerous design advancements, from B-17A to G.The B-17 was primarily employed in the daylight precision strategic bombing campaign of World War II against German industrial, civilian and military targets.  The United States Eighth Air Force based in England and the Fifteenth Air Force based in Italy complemented the RAF Bomber Command's nighttime area bombing in Operation Pointblank, to help secure air superiority over the cities, factories and battlefields of Western Europe in preparation for Operation Overlord. This machine was nicknamed the \"Flying Fortress\" because of its eight machine guns and three cannons.",
